From 2004 to 2018, the show was hosted by <a href=#><strong>Heidi Klum</strong></a> with fashion guru<a href=#><strong> Tim Gunn</strong></a> acting as a mentor for the competitors. The longtime costars confirmed in September 2018 that they <a href=#>would not be returning</a> for the show’s 17th season after signing onto Amazon Prime’s Making the Cut. They were replaced by<a href=#><strong> Karlie Kloss</strong> </a>and season 4 Project Runway winner <a href=#><strong>Christian Siriano</strong></a>.</p><p>“We were in lockstep … I never dreamed that [Project Runway] would have a second season,” Gunn told Variety in a joint interview with Klum in March 2020. “Who knew? … There’s a <a href=#>love and respect</a> there that we’ll always have.”</p><p>Through its more than 250 episodes, Project Runway has been a champion for <a href=#>diversity and innovation</a> in the fashion industry. Despite facing “stigma” for his unconventional rise to the top of the design world, Siriano credited his time on the series with helping him become a household name.</p><p>“Right now, in our world, with what’s happening in our culture and everything, I feel like you just have to find new ways to support your company and your brand. Young designers and young businesses are going under every single day,” he told the <a href=#>Washington Post</a> in April 2019. “So I really treated it as, ‘I can show the world what I can do — and maybe bring a new generation of customer to us.’ And I mean, obviously, when I was on that show, I was 21 years old — an actual child! And now, having a business, 40 employees, a real company, people can see what you start with and what you can turn it into.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As Kloss and Siriano step into their new roles on the runway, they’ve brought along bright new voices on the judges’ panel, like designer <a href=#><strong>Brandon Maxwell</strong> </a>and former editor-in-chief of Teen Vogue <a href=#><strong>Elaine Welteroth</strong></a>.</p><p>“I think it’s been cool to transform the legacy brand of Project Runway into something that feels really relevant for this moment, this time,” Welteroth told <a href=#>Parade</a> magazine in April 2020. “We all had a say and had input. It felt like there was no reason to continue on with a legacy brand like Project Runway if it wasn’t going to really <a href=#>reflect what’s happening in the world right now</a> and if it wasn’t going to be inclusive.”</p><p>Scroll down to take a look back at Project Runway winners through the years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Blv7C2xJyrZqqlo8SixYywoKemlafAbsPHnqmeZZGnsm7Ax56wZqafrHy0scCnZKSdnKHGbr%2FEmqqopl1mgHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
