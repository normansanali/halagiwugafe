And winning the Feb 2022 final round comes second. Before the finale, the expert revealed that she finally beat cancer that she battled with during ABC game show auditions.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Keep reading this Christine Whelchel Bio to learn more about her.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Christine Whelchel On Jepoardy</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Christine Whelchel found herself stuck in a tiebreaker with a Henry Rozycki in the final round after the top three were given a clue — 1949 review noted the “wrong formulas for success” of this character &”‘fatal misconceptions about his place in the scheme of thing” — form the category “Play Characters.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As all of them gave correct answers i.e. “Willy Loman”, Christine and Henry each scored $34,000, while Patrick Byrnett ended up with $17,600, leading him out of the competition.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So, forced to compete in a rare tiebreaker, host Ken Jennings then revealed that the first competitor to buzz the correct answer would win the game. Their next was “Flowers,” with the clue reading “After its inclusion in a 1915 poem, this red flower became a symbol of fallen World War I soldiers.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Christine chimed in quickly! — “Poppy,” she said. And that was the moment she was announced as the new </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Jeopardy!</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> Champion.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But while the tiebreaker may have seemed simple to many, a few had questions like what if Christine was incorrect does the other person win? Also, if the show is assuming the correct answer moves on and doesn’t want further delay then they will try to make it a slightly easier question?</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Well, here’s the answer — if the 1st person answers incorrectly, the other has to ring in and answer as well. If neither answers correctly, they edit out the clue and replace it with a new one.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Being said that, many still felt like it was a bad decision for them to be prompted to a tie-breaker.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“Why don’t you change the rule to split the money and have both contestants back?” a user wrote.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“Foolish not to wager the $1.00 difference. Got lucky to win the whole thing,” another commented.</span></p><h3><b>Christine Whelchel Cancer</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Christine Whelchel was diagnosed with breast cancer in Mach 2021. However, one of the first things she did after being diagnosed was — take the </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Jeopardy! </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>test. She ended up getting her just audition the night before her surgery in May.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Luckily, everything went well. She is now in remission, or to put it simply, cancer-free for the time being.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, the champ’s revelation about her battle with cancer was featured on official </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Jeopardy!</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> Twitter post captioned, “Cancer-free and now on Jeopardy! Congratulations, Christine.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Over the shared video, we can see Ken introducing Christine as a breast-cancer survivor and asking him to share more about it.</span></p><h3><b>Christine Whelchel Age</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Christine Whelchel was 37 years of age when she became </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Jeopardy!</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> Champ in Feb 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>She celebrates her birthday on September 14, making her of the Virgo zodiac.</span></p><h3><b>Is Christine Whelchel Married?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Yes, Christine Whelchel was believed to be married.

Most of her students were already performing the classics over big stages.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Besides teaching music, Christine herself often performed on stage. The last we saw her, Christine was playing several classical standards in an event hosted by the </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Lyceum Committee of Columbia State Community College</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, here’s her </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>LinkedIn</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> (now-deleted).</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>For those of you curious, an average piano teacher in Tennesse earned around $30 per hour.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for her education, Christine attended the </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU) School of Music</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Before Christine </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Jeopardy!</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> victory, </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>MTSU</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> took it to their official FB page to cheer their alumna.
