When she would come back home from school and talk to her mother about somebody she had a crush on, her mother would enquire about looks and traits and casually ask if the person was a boy or a girl as that was never a big deal. That approach had a huge impact on Zuri, as she otherwise would not have felt safe presenting her true sexual inclination in a homophobic society.</li><li>Zuri has recalled that when she was first signed on to Good Trouble, she got blown away as her character Malika felt like a soulmate of hers. She had read the script and concluded, that was the assignment destined for her. It had given her great pleasure knowing what the creators were standing for, and what their aims were in terms of exposing the liberation movement, as those were all the things she has been passionate about.</li><p>Featured Image by Zuri Adele / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jrOsq6FdlrGmuMRo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
