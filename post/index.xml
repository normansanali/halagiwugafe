And there's a full moon in the sky
You hear a dog bark in the distance
You hear someone's baby cry
A rat runs down the alley
And a chill runs down your spine
Someone walks across your grave
And you wish the sun would shine
No one's gonna warn you
And no one's gonna yell 'Attack'
And you don't feel the steel
Till it's hanging out your back</description></item><item><title>Appendix:Black and White walkthrough - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</title><link>/appendix-black-and-white-walkthrough.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/appendix-black-and-white-walkthrough.html</guid><description>From Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokémon encyclopedia.

そのボーカルのヨンスさんの注目度は日々上がっています。
ボーカルでありながらも、
イケメンでおしゃれである彼は、
髪型とファッションも注目されています。
ヨンスさん自身も、
ボーカルはスターであるべきと語り、
自身の見た目や発言に気を配っているようです。
Suchmosさんが成長していけばいくほど、
ヨンスさんの影響力は大きくなっていきますが、
すでに、彼と同じ髪型やファッションを意識してる方も多いみたいです。
ヨンスの韓国風の髪型 神奈川の湘南出身のヨンスさんは、
爽やかなファッションと髪型をしてます。
ヨンスさんについて調べて探すと、
「韓国」というキーワードが出てきますが、
それは彼の髪型が韓流風だからだと思います。
（決してヨンスさんが韓国出身というわけではないです）
色白で骨格がしっかりした男らしい顔立ちなので、
髪型もダンディで男らしい感じになっていて素敵です。
たまにはんにゃの金田さんに似てるという声もありますが、確かに髪型だけでいえばそっくりです。。笑
ちなみに前髪があると可愛いです！
ヨンスさんのファッションに影響を与えたのは、
ジョニーデップやジョーストラマーなどで、
決して、韓流が好きなわけではないみたいですが、
確かにパッと見、好きなそうには見えますね・・・笑
結局、自分に似合う髪型やファッションを探して、
今の感じに落ち着いたのかな？と。
長い髪も短い髪も似合うので、そこは臨機応変に流行に合わせていくのが無難かなと思います。イケメンでよかったですね。。
ヨンスがタトゥー入れた事件 少し前に、ヨンスさんがタトゥーを入れたとして、
インスタやツイッターでファンがざわざわしてました。
やはりヨンスさんには女性ファンが多いので、
我が子を見守る気持ちで応援している方が多いのでしょう。
「自分の体を傷つけるなんて！」とお母さんのようなブーイングが多数でした。。笑
ちなみにヨンスさんのタトゥーはこのような感じ。
なんのマークでしょうか？
憶測ではアメリカインディアンのシンボルモチーフのButterflyで、
蝶々で意味は「Everlasting Life （永遠の命）」だそうです。
身近で誰かが亡くなったか、もしくはバンド活動の縁担ぎ的な意味でしょうか？
このタトゥーの意味は、いつかヨンスさん自らの口で語る日がくることでしょう。
ヨンスのファッションは湘南系？ ヨンスさんのメディア衣装や、
私服などを見ていると、
アディダスのジャージを着てることが多いです。
ライブやミュージックビデオでは、
アディダスオリジナルのトラックトップを着てることが多いです。
ヨンスさんが着ているアディダスのジャケットは、
adidas originalsのATPトラックジャケットというものです。
ハマるとそればりを着る性格なのでしょうか？
あまりにも色違いを持ちすぎててびっくりですね！笑
湘南生まれ、湘南在住というステータスが魅力ですが、
確かに爽やかで涼しい色使いは魅力的です。
時には革ジャンなどを着ることもあり、
ロックスターらしい着こなしも決まっています。</description></item><item><title> 'Million Dollar Listing's Josh Flagg Scoops Up $4.45 Mil Miami Beach</title><link>/josh-flagg-miami-beach-home-million-dollar-listing-los-angeles.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/josh-flagg-miami-beach-home-million-dollar-listing-los-angeles.html</guid><description>Gallery Launch Gallery The Miami Pad Launch Gallery Gallery Zillow Composite Josh Flagg is now the proud owner of an impressive Miami Beach pad ... making it clear he's out to grow his property portfolio with a real estate shopping spree.

WWE Smackdown Review 7/8/11
By Adrian Arciuli for Wrestlezone.com
Rating- 6/10
Smackdown this week was a case of the good the bad and the ugly with Friday’s show failing to live up to the expectations of week’s past.

The show didn’t end with much fan fare. Randy Orton just gave an RKO to Sheamus after the Celtic Warrior took out Christian with a Brogue kick.</description></item><item><title>Benjamin Duhamel Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</title><link>/benjamin-duhamel-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-281521-html.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/benjamin-duhamel-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-281521-html.html</guid><description>Patrice Duhamel And Nathalie Saint-Cricq are the guardians of Benjamin Duhamel, a notable character.
