The couple went from being PDA-heavy and doing red carpet appearances together at the beginning of the year, to barely being seen in recent months.</p><p>Now, a new report claims that Kylie’s mother <a href=#>Kris Jenner</a> may have played a part in driving the two apart, but not even intentionally, as it sounds like the Kardashian-Jenner lifestyle may be a bit much for Chalamet.</p><h2 id=kris-supposedly-supported-kylie-and-timothee-but-became-overbearing>Kris Supposedly Supported Kylie And Timothee, But Became Overbearing</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/kris-jenner-1.jpg><p><a href=#>Speaking to Star Magazine</a>, a source claims that Kris was supportive of Kylie and Timothee’s romance from the get-go, as she sees him not only good for her daughter, but also for the family brand.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Kris thinks he’s the ultimate catch," the source claimed. "He has huge star power along with this intellectual cachet, and Kris thinks he can elevate the family into a classier social category."</p><p>However, Kris may have overstepped her boundaries. The source said the momager attempted to arrange brand deals for Timothee as well as invivte him to events and family functions without consulting Kylie first, likely leading to friction in the couple’s relationship.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/instar52264312-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Timothée Chalamet's Highest Grossing Films, And How Much Money They Made</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Timothée Chalamet is a blazing star in the movie industry, and his impressive filmography is proof of it.</span><p>Timothee may have even felt that Kris was coming on too strong considering her reputation for monetizing her family and doing PR control.</p><p>"Kris has meddled in every one of Kylie’s relationships,” the insider continued, calling the matriarch “overbearing.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kylie and Timothee have been reluctant to talk about their relationship recently, despite ongoing rumors that the pair are no longer together. The makeup mogul even refused to refer to Timothee in a recent interview, adding to the rumors that something is amiss between the pair.</p><h2 id=why-fans-think-timothee-and-kylie-are-taking-a-break>Why Fans Think Timothee And Kylie Are Taking A Break</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/kylie-jenner-and-timothee-chalamet.jpg><p>It's not just fans theorizing that the couple are having relationship problems. Reports claim the two are on a “break” as they try to sort things out.</p><p>"They’re hardly together anymore,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source told OK! Magazine.</a> “Their lives got busy, and they drifted apart. Of course, once their schedules quiet down, that could all change."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Timothee has been filming a new biopic on Bob Dylan in New York, Kylie has been busy doing promotional work in Los Angeles for her various business ventures, including her new vodka seltzer, Sprinter, and Kylie Cosmetic’s first perfume, Cosmic.</p><p>The source explained that while the pair have chosen to prioritize work over their relationship for now, there’s still hope for a reconciliation. “They still care about each other, so maybe they’ll pick up where they left off. Or maybe it will be out of sight, out of mind," they continued.</p><p>This supports other reports that have suggested Timothee was worried how his relationship with Kylie was affecting his career, particularly after rumors flew at the Golden Globes that they’d had drama with Selena Gomez.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/this-is-how-kris-jenner-spends-her-mammoth-net-worth-1b.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>This Is How Kris Jenner Spends Her Mammoth Net Worth</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Kris Jenner has done well for herself over the years by being a "momager" given that she is creeping toward a $200 million net worth.</span><p>"Timothee didn't like all the attention he got from the Golden Globes, and the kiss took away attention for the real reason he was there," an insider said in January. "His career is taking off and he wants to protect it and let it thrive based on his talent — not on who he is or isn’t dating. He also wants to protect his relationship with Kylie.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For now, it appears fans will have to keep guessing about what’s going on in Kylie and Timothee’s relationship.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiiq6GjYremus2eqWallZmxrbHDZqKypJmaequxzaecq2WknrqwwMeenGabmJa5ornErapmqpWhrrW1zqeqoaGgYrOiutJmmZ6kmZrDpnnOp2SbqpWWuHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
