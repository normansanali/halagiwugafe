Serving size 
When reading the Nutrition Information Panel (NIP), pay close attention to the serving size, the number of serves per package and a breakdown of nutrients in the product. 
The per 100g column comes in handy here when you are comparing the nutrients between products, as serving sizes are simply declared by the manufacturer and can vary from product to product. 
Energy
The second thing to take into account on the NIP is energy, which is measured in either kilojoules (kJ) or calories."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It’s important to consider both the amount and the type of fat,’ the NDSS reports.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>With the total fat amount, Eat For Health recommends you should aim for less than 10g per 100g.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>With milk and yoghurt, look for less than 2g per 100g, and with cheese, opt for those with less than 15g per 100g.</p><p

femail-ccox mol-style-medium">Carbohydrates</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>While carbs are not bad for you, you should keep an eye on them because the words ‘total carbohydrate’ includes both the sugars and the starches in food.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The ‘sugars’ amount tells you how much of the total carbohydrate is made up of sugars.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It includes both added sugars and natural sugars such as lactose in milk and fructose in fruit.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Keep these down to stay healthy and if you want a quick way of identifying how much of your food is sugar, check the ingredients list.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>If sugar or one of the other words for sugar like stevia, fructose, glucose, syrup or honey are one of the first to be listed, you know you’re in trouble.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold femail-ccox mol-style-medium">Sodium</span></p><h3 class=mol-factbox-title>How much salt?</h3><p class=mol-para-with-font>* Choose products with under 120mg per 100g.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Sodium is one of the most important things to look at on the NIP.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Where possible, choose products with ‘reduced’ or ‘no added’ salt.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Alternatively,&nbsp;choose products with under 120mg per 100g.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold femail-ccox mol-style-medium">THE INGREDIENTS LIST</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>If you want to quickly see what a product has in it, check the ingredients list – which must see all ingredients be listed in descending order by weight.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>If sugar or fat or one of their ‘other names’ are towards the top of the list, chances are the packaged food isn’t that good for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As a general rule of thumb, opt for products with whole, natural ingredients and try to pick packaged foods with small lists.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold femail-ccox mol-style-medium">THE CLAIMS</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Food manufacturers&nbsp;often use nutrition claims on their packaging to attract the shopper’s attention.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>While the claim may be true, it may also be misleading – so it’s useful to know the meaning of nutrition claims.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold femail-ccox mol-style-medium">Reduced salt</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The label ‘reduced salt’ might have you reaching for the item and placing it in your shopping trolley, but you shouldn’t be quite so fast without consulting the label.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Reduced salt merely means the product contains at least 25 per cent less salt than the regular product.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>However, the reduced salt version may still have a high salt content.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold femail-ccox mol-style-medium">Light or lite&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>You might see these words and assume they refer to a reduced fat content.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But this can also be used to describe taste, texture or colour in a food item.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>For example, light olive oil is lighter in colour and taste, but not lower in fat.&nbsp;</p><img decoding=async id=i-21ef72a2e9ccb58f

can also&nbsp;be used to describe taste, texture or colour in a food item (stock image)</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold femail-ccox mol-style-medium">No added sugar</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This means the product contains no added sugars, like sucrose, honey or glucose.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But the item may still contain natural sugars, like milk (lactose), fruit (fructose) or other carbohydrates, which can all affect your blood glucose levels.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold femail-ccox mol-style-medium">Reduced fat</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Like a reduced salt label, a reduced fat tag does mean the product contains at least 25 per cent less fat than the regular product.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>However, this doesn’t mean it’s low in fat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold femail-ccox mol-style-medium">HEALTH STAR RATING SYSTEM</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The last thing to take a look at is the Health Star Rating System, which is designed to help you choose healthier foods at a glance.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Packaged foods are rated at between a half and 5 stars.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The rating is calculated according to ingredients that increase the risk of obesity and contribute to other chronic diseases. The more stars, the healthier the product.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8eemKWsmGK7psPSaK6erpVir6axzWapnpmUnruoec2uq6uhpJ68r3nLmpmepKNixLO7zaBkmqScYsGptdJmq6KllWLAtrPAq6pmoZ6YubawxJ1koqZdqbWmecKaqZunmK6xs63TnqpmpqWir6a%2Bjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
