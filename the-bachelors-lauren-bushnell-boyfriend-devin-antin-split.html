The former flight attendant and Higgins, 30, got engaged during the season 20 finale of The Bachelor, which aired in March 2016.

Fast forward two years later when I moved back to L.A. we hung out to catch up and things just kinda happened after that.”</p><p>More recently, Bushnell admitted exclusively to Us Weekly that she is a <a href=#>“bit overly cautious” with her love life</a> after her time on the ABC dating series.</p><p>“I’ve always been someone who maybe jumps into things a little too quickly and I fall really fast,” the reality TV personality told&nbsp;Us on August 6. “And I always had this idea that I was going to be married by this age, kids, and this was going to be my plan … and now, I mean I’m almost 29 but I don’t really have a timestamp on anything anymore, which is nice. And maybe I should a little more. But I think going through the past and my past engagement and&nbsp;The Bachelor has made me want to just take things a little bit slower and not rush anything.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatoJVir6Kvx56jqKqjYrmiwdGepWaapai1r7HLpWSbp6mbv6qxzZ1knZ2mnrturc2toKdlo6W5qsCO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
