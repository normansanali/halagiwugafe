"Every single one of them. I look at Brandi and think, 'I made that!'"</p><p id=eO4ygE5Kl4P data-wc=22>She talked more specifically about her 31-year-old daughter Miley, stating that they: "Have such a beautiful working relationship and a mother-daughter relationship."</p><p id=e-snCTEMgO data-wc=39>As a child star, Miley rocketed to fame and became a teen idol.

"She doesn't drink or smoke weed," Brandi explained. Nor does Brandi, although she recognized how the drug has helped her mom to control her anxiety.</p><p id=e6q3-GRweG data-wc=46>The 56-year-old has spoken openly about her mental health, particularly in reference to her recent divorce. Speaking to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>People</a>, Tish explained: "When I literally was going through my divorce and trying to make that decision of stepping out of a 30-year marriage, I was terrified mostly."</p><p id=e9xwDLxTp2y data-wc=26>She continued: "I thought I was going to be alone forever.
