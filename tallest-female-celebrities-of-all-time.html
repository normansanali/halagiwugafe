Kristen Johnston</h2><p>Height: 6 feet</p><p>Kristen Johnson is an actress who is best known for her role on the television sitcom “Mom.” Johnston is 6 feet tall, but it hasn’t prevented her from carving out a successful niche for herself in television. She also appeared in the NBC television comedy “3rd Rock from the Sun.” She admitted in an interview that her height was something that made her self-conscious when she was first starting. She was aware that it held a lot of aspiring actresses back, but she achieved success nonetheless.

Brigitte Nielsen</h2><p>Height: 6 feet 1</p><p>Brigitte Nielsen established herself as a professional model early in her career. During the 1980s, her height worked in her favor.

The former spouse of Sylvester Stallone eased into the film industry, appearing with her then-husband in “Rocky IV,” and “Cobra.” She made it to the big screen with no problems, although the marriage to Stallone ended in divorce.</p><h2>5. Caitlyn Jenner</h2><p>Height: 6 feet 2</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>According to The Delite</a>, Caitlyn Jenner is one of the tallest celebrity women in the business today. However, we would be remiss to point out that Jenner was born a biological male, and males are genetically larger and taller than women, so Jenner only makes the list since deciding that being a biological male is no longer something the celebirty is interested in. Sometimes we have to remind ourselves that Caitlyn was once an Olympic athlete. She towers over the rest of the Jenners-Kardashian clan, and the women in the family are not short. She is best known for her appearances in Kardashian’s television reality series. She was married to Kris Jenner before transitioning from male to female. The relationship didn’t work out for the couple, but Caitlyn has continued to remain in the spotlight as a role model for young people contemplating their sexuality and entertaining the notion of making their transitions.</p><h2>4. Elizabeth Debicki</h2><p>Height: 6 feet 2</p><p>Elizabeth Debicki is an Australian actress who is best known for her role in the 2013 film “The Great Gatsby.” She co-starred with Leonardo DiCaprio. Leo is a six-footer himself, but she beat him in height by two inches.</p><h2>3. Judy Gold</h2><p>Height: 6 feet 2</p><p>Judy Gold is an actress and comedian we’ve come to love over the past two decades. She’s been around a while, but not always in the spotlight. In 2011 she hosted “Te Judy Gold Show: My Life as a Sitcom,” for which she is still recognized. She earned two Emmy Awards from her efforts as producer and writer for “The Rosie O’Donnell Show.” Judy has done a little bit of everything in her years in the entertainment industry. She’s one of the mega-talents that has done a lot of work behind the scenes, but when she took the center stage, her comedy was appreciated. She is another celebrity figure who didn’t allow being tall to hold her back or keep her in the shadows. When it was time for her to step out, she did so.</p><h2>2. Gwendoline Christie</h2><p>Height: 6 ft 3</p><p>Gwendoline Christie is the second-tallest female celebrity on our list. She is 6 feet 3 inches, but it hasn’t stopped her from becoming a sensation in the entertainment industry. Christie is a model and actress, best known for her role as Brienne of Tarth in “Game of Thrones.” She also appeared in “The Force Awakens,” and “The Last Jedi” installments of the “Star Wars” franchise.</p><h2>1.
