It also made her the richest "American Horror Story" cast member, albeit in a roundabout way. The star's mom is the late Carrie Fisher&nbsp;– or, as she's known in a galaxy far, far away, Princess Leia. Does that also make Lourd royalty? It depends on the line of succession, but Lourd did briefly take her mother's place on the throne. In "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker," the actor served as her mother's body double.</p><p dir=ltr>"It was a poignant thing and something that nobody took lightly — that she was willing to stand in for her mom," ILM Visual Effects Supervisor Patrick Tubach told <a href=#>Yahoo! Entertainment</a>. "It was an emotional thing for everybody to see her in that position."</p><p dir=ltr>That's an impressive weight to carry for such a young actor. The star only made her debut in 2015, first with Ryan Murphy's "Scream Queens" and then as Lieutenant Connix in "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" (a role she's since reprised). Though she became an "AHS" regular after "Scream Queens" was <a href=#>canceled in 2017</a>, most of her money doesn't actually come from her career just yet.</p><p>According to the&nbsp;<a href=#>Daily Mail</a>, Fisher left Lourd a&nbsp;<a href=#>nearly $25 million inheritance</a>&nbsp;when she died in 2016. This reportedly included "her $18 million estate," the rights to her image, and "$6.8 million in cash." At the time of this writing, <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a> estimates that Lourd is worth $20 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb2thboF3e9OhnGaqmZi1pr%2FTZpimnaKesKK6jKGmq6qfp3q0wM6rsGabkajBbrnEppmeql2itqi002aqrqqgp7a0sYyypq5n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
