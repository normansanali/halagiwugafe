Prince William revealed his daughter, Princess Charlotte, already thinks she’s a teenager after turning 6 years old earlier this month.
“If you ask her, she says she’s 16,” William, 38, told one organizer while visiting Babcock Vehicle Engineering in Walsall, England, on Tuesday, May 4. “Charlotte says, ‘I’m 6 now, I’ll do what I want.’ They grow up very fast.”
The Duke of Cambridge spoke about Charlotte’s Sunday, May 2, birthday celebrations, while learning about the company’s efforts to create new ventilators used during the coronavirus pandemic health crisis on Tuesday."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>
