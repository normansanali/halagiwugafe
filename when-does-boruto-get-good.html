Recommended Videos While the series had quite a bit of hype and momentum from the get-go given that it was a continuation of one of the most beloved anime series of all time, many fans wrote the show off entirely not long after it aired."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Despite its rocky start, the show has recently picked up steam and the story is in a much better place. This should give Naruto fans hope for a brighter future and a renewed reason to check the series out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/photo-1-15518581235693526406391280x720-1-1.png><p data-characters=173 data-current-count=173 data-injectable=false>The Boruto fan community seems to <a href=#>share a similar sentiment</a> on when the show begins to get good, with most suggesting that from the Chunin Exam arc onward, it only improves.</p><p data-characters=375 data-current-count=548 data-injectable=true>If you had to select a single episode to begin watching from, episode 50 is likely the best place to hop in, as it’s all uphill from there. If you have the time and the will, however, then watching the previous episodes is going to provide some context, as it offers more insight into Boruto’s new characters and the situation present in the Leaf Village during the show.</p><p data-characters=257 data-current-count=257 data-injectable=false>A big reason why the show has suddenly improved is because the original Naruto writer Kishimoto has returned to the series from the manga Chapter 52, meaning that if you were a fan of the original series, then going forward you should notice a similar tone.</p><p data-characters=247 data-current-count=504 data-injectable=false>If you’re looking to check the series out but don’t have the time to catch it all, then instead of skipping the first 50 episodes, we suggest that you use this <strong>Boruto</strong> <a href=#>filler guide</a> to skip over the episodes that aren’t necessary to the story.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6wn56mXZm8pr%2BMm6arraSkeqix02aeqKeUZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
