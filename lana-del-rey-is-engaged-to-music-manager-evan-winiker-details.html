Six months later, the pair enjoyed a date night at Pappy and Harriet’s restaurant in Pioneertown, California, where the “Young & Beautiful” singer posed for photos with her fans.</p><p>Rumors swirled that Del Rey and Winiker were engaged earlier this month after she was seen sporting a <a href=#>diamond ring</a> while attending the Billboard Women in Music event.</p><p>Before becoming a talent manager, Winiker was a member of the indie rock band Steel Train from 2002 to 2013 alongside <a href=#><strong>Jack Antonoff</strong></a>. Following the group’s disbandment, Antonoff, 38, played guitar in fun., which went on hiatus in 2015. He is now the lead singer of Bleachers and works as a producer, <a href=#>collaborating with Del Rey</a>, <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Lorde</strong></a> and more. (Antonoff is listed as a producer on Del Rey’s latest record, Did You Know That There’s A Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd, which dropped earlier this month.)</p><p>The “Doin’ Time” artist, for her part, was previously linked to <a href=#><strong>Sean “Sticks” Larkin</strong></a>. The Live PD star, 49, and Del Rey began dating in September 2019. One month later, the <a href=#>Grammy nominee</a> addressed backlash from fans regarding her then-partner’s profession.</p><p>“It’s funny because I was with someone for years and we never had that problem,” she shared in an October 2019 <a href=#>L.A. Times</a> profile. “He’s a good cop. He gets it. He sees both sides of things.”</p><p>Del Rey brought the law enforcement officer as her date to the 2020 <a href=#>Grammys</a>, two months after they <a href=#>made their red carpet debut</a> the pair called it quits in March 2020, but they seemingly remained on good terms.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Right now, we’re just friends,” Larkin explained in a March 2020 <a href=#>New York Times </a>interview. “We still talk and whatnot, we just have busy schedules right now.”</p><p>Five months after her split from Larkin, Del Rey moved on with singer <a href=#><strong>Clayton Johnson</strong></a>. In December 2020, Us confirmed that Johnson, 34, and the “Video Games” musician were engaged, but the twosome broke up in summer 2021.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalmZ6WeqWxy2apnrFdnsBusc2gmKCdlGLBsHnMrqqim12irq%2Btxp6pZp2mlrtuw8inoKSdomKxpsDAoqOsZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
