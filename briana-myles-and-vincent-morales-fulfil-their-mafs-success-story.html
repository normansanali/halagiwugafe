However, their journey didnâ€™t come without differences, such as their inability to agree on the topic of children.</p><p>Some couples who have tried to make a blind marriage work on the same season havenâ€™t quite had the same outcome, but Briana and Vincent convinced viewers that love at first sight really does existâ€¦</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><p>So, where are the married couple now and what have they been up to since filming wrapped? Recently, Briana traveled with Vincent to his home town for the first time, living up to being an MAFS total success story.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2021/03/vincent-morales-1024x576.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-briana-and-vincent-s-mafs-story>Briana and Vincentâ€™s MAFS story</h2><p>Briana and Vincent first met on their wedding day, so their relationship started pretty differently to most general couples across the globe. However, their blind date seriously paid off, and they went on to fall in love.</p><p>From wearing blinds while answering questions about each other, to Vincent buying Briana a bicycle, they had a few issues. He ended up getting upset over Briana being â€˜disrespectfulâ€™ and bossy at times, but they worked through it.</p><p>During their wedding day, they instantly hit it off and agreed they would go cycling together. He even showed just how dedicated he is to Briana by becoming a doting father to her dog, Cookie.</p><p>On the note of family, he made it known to Briana that he wanted children. However, she admitted she is afraid of childbirth and wasnâ€™t so sure about starting a family of their own. Despite the odds, their love conquered all!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Vincent and Briana are SO cute.

During their trip to Santo Domingo, in the Dominican Republic, he was over the moon to show his wife around, and <a href=# rel=nofollow>wrote</a>:</p><p>Man, this was the trip of a lifetime. My baby finally got to see my roots!</p><p>The pair were so happy with the trip that they made a <a href=# rel=nofollow>YouTube video</a> of the entire holiday. So if youâ€™re missing your scoop on Briana and Vincent from season 12, then donâ€™t worry, theyâ€™re regularly sharing their travels online.</p><p>Dinner dates, shisha, palm tree-surrounded walks and getting a sense of Vincentâ€™s culture growing up was the main focus of their trip. Briana also mentioned that her husband was right about learning Spanish being easier there.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Briana and Vincent are literally my favorite couple ðŸ¥¹ <a href=#>#MAFS</a></p>â€” ash âœ¨ (@ashhhhhbashhhh) <a href=#>May 20, 2022</a></figure>View Tweet<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-lifetime-pair-are-happier-than-ever>The Lifetime pair are happier than ever</h2><p>Briana and Vincent have been just as in love since filming wrapped as they were during <a href=#>MAFS</a>. Of course, they had some hurdles to overcome while season 12 was carried out, but itâ€™s all paid off.</p><p>Theyâ€™ve launched a YouTube channel together which already has at least 20K subscribers, moved in together, gone on several date nights in each otherâ€™s company and gone on weekend getaways.</p><p>Travel appears to be their utmost priority, as well as surrounding themselves with friends.
