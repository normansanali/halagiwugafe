She also didn’t appreciate that Genasis never reached out to her about his plans regarding her music nor sent her a check for it.</p><p class=dh>“I think it’s just kind of hurtful as an artist,” Cole <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/B6RQL9FAizW/>said</a>. “There was no, ‘Hey how you doing? What’s up? How you feel about this?’”</p><p class=dh>Cole explains that she’s at a point in her career when she’s trying to get her music back to where it used to be but Genasis’ remix just made it difficult. This is because people would never listen to her music the same way again.</p><p class=dh>As such, the singer <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/B6RQL9FAizW/>said</a>, “I really would like my classics to be left alone.”</p><p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>GENASIS' REACTION</strong></h3></p><p class=dh>Genasis first made headlines when he suspected Cole was his hater who instigated the deletion of his “Never Knew” video on YouTube. <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.tmz.com/2019/12/18/ot-genasis-side-eye-keyshia-cole-cover-never-knew-removed-youtube/>TMZ</a> reported that the rapper warned that it Cole was involved, he’d let the world know.</p><p class=dh>At the time, the publication stated that Cole admitted to liking Genasis’ cover of her song and even found it funny. But that doesn’t seem to be the case now.</p><p class=dh>Upon learning of Cole’s new comments, Genasis took to his Instagram and shared the clip from her show. He then <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/B6RQL9FAizW/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading">wrote</a>, "Damn Keyshia it’s like dat? I thought u was from da Bay ? I thought it was California love."</p><p class=dh>Genasis later said that his remix was all in the spirit of fun and that it even encouraged listeners to listen to “Love” again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpvcGloanqqedaorKWcXaLGbq%2FLmqqsoZOoeqOxjKWcn6xdlrmwusRmop6xo522b7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
