It was announced that the <a href=#>Asus RT-AC87U</a> would be the first QSR1000 enabled router to hit retail. Despite the announcement at CES, no availability date or price was announced.</p><p>Things are getting together now, and Asus and Quantenna have announced that the RT-AC87U is all set to ship (Best Buy actually has it for <a href=#>purchase</a> right now). The router will retail for $270, an admittedly steep price, but one that should be seen in context with the Broadcom-XStream enabled Netgear R8000 that is shipping for $300. The router also seems to be a bit lacking in the I/O front, with only one USB 2.0 port apparently. [ <strong>Update</strong>: Some readers have mentioned that a USB 3.0 port is hidden beneath a flap in the front. ] That said, it is like that most of the power users who are going to purchase this already have a dedicated NAS device (and don't need USB 3.0 or eSATA ports in their routers).</p><p>The RT-AC87U is a bit more future-proof with respect to Wi-Fi standards, thanks to it being the first shipping <a href=#>802.11ac Wave 2</a> router. As part of the Wave 2 features, we get four spatial streams and support for MU-MIMO (we do need clients supporting it to get the full benefits). One of the most obvious benefits of going to Wave 2 is the 160 MHz-wide channel support, but, that is not part of the Quantenna QSR1000 chipset that is being used in the Asus RT-AC87U.</p><p>Obviously, technology moves at a rapid pace, and one can always wait for the next big thing. There is also talk online of <a href=#>Netgear releasing a Wave 2 router (Nighthawk X4)</a> soon (the <a href=#>FCC</a> <a href=#>details</a> are already out), but official details are scarce. In effect, if readers are interested in hopping on to the Wave 2 bandwagon, the Asus RT-AC87U will be the first opportunity.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIVzg5domKyto2K%2Fta3CcW5mmZNngXF8jKumrqyVp3q4tdOhZKqtkaPBprrNmmScoJmlwKbAjKycrWWkpHq0tMip</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
