Recommended Videos If that sounds like pure hype, remember that Insomniac’s previous two titles in the series — Marvel’s Spider-Man (2018) and Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales (2020) — were well-received by critics and fans, who appreciated the freedom Insomniac granted players to swing around Manhattan, complete missions in their preferred order, and take selfies in Battery Park while passersby either high-five Spidey or glitch into a nearby bush."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In fact, we’d wager that Insomiac’s work on this series might one day be comparable to Rocksteady’s near-perfect adaptation of Batman for the Arkham trilogy, one of the most celebrated superhero gaming series of all time.</p><p data-characters=174 data-current-count=174 data-injectable=false>But which version of Spider-Man 2 should you preorder? Besides the regular version, there’s a more expensive Deluxe Edition that comes with a set of exclusive costumes.</p><h2 id=h-what-suits-are-only-available-with-the-deluxe-edition data-injectable=false>What suits are only available with the Deluxe Edition?</h2><p data-characters=24 data-current-count=198 data-injectable=false>Check out these threads:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Spider-Man-2-deluxe-edition-suits.png><p data-characters=144 data-current-count=144 data-injectable=false>Some of these suits look pretty wild, but many are subtle references to previous moments across Marvel comics, movies, and games, per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Rant</a>.</p><p data-characters=277 data-current-count=421 data-injectable=true>For example, the Tactical Suit’s white and red motif might be a nod to the 2018 Spider-Man‘s Advanced Armored Suit, the Track Suit in 2020’s Miles Morales, or even Miguel O’Hara’s Parker Industries Suit that featured in the Spider-Man 2099 comics.</p><p data-characters=410 data-current-count=410 data-injectable=true>How about the Aurantia Suit? The yellow detailing definitely serves Iron Spider vibes (from the MCU films), but it appears to be a deeper cut than that: The black undersuit matched with the red padding and yellow accents seems to be based on the Integrated Suit from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spider-Man: No Way Home</a>, where Tom Holland’s Iron Spider nanites assimilate with Doc Ock’s tentacles and create an updated costume.</p><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=363 data-injectable=false>The hood on the Red Spectre Suit recalls Spider-Gwen’s (or Spider-Woman’s) costume in the animated <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spider-Verse</a> films, while the Apunkalyptic Suit is a clear reference to Spider-Punk, AKA Hobie Brown, from this year’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</a>. And hey, doesn’t the Encoded Suit look a lot like Yellowjacket in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ant-Man</a> films?</p><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=661 data-injectable=true>We won’t spoil all the references. Just know that the Deluxe Edition will only make you nerdier, which is a great reason to select that version of the game if you have enough funds. If not, we guess you’re stuck with the core version of what promises to be a really great game. Win-win.</p><p data-characters=69 data-current-count=69 data-injectable=false>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 arrives on Oct. 20 for the PlayStation 5.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZorqGZpGLAtrXTrGSaqpVirretyKWYm6SVYravedOhnGaroJ6xpr6MppinZWJisaa41LGcZp2UnsGqu81o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
