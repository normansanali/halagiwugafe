In it, one passionate user pointed out the film’s flaws with an in-depth analysis of the film’s “extreme gore” that has been deemed as unnecessary. Furthermore, the OP touched upon the glaring fact that the 2013 rendition doesn’t include enough humor — especially when you consider that the original Evil Dead movies are rooted in dark comedy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Evil-Dead-2013.jpg><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=655 data-injectable=true>Then again, the statement does come as a major surprise, seeing as the long-standing horror franchise is undoubtedly known for its violence, gore, and outright unsettling elements. In fact, the movie’s gory sequences proved to be so horrific that Evil Dead (2013) was eventually banned in 3 nations — and that would be Finland, Ukraine, and Singapore.</p><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>Over 10 years on, it seems hard to believe that the above countries would still have a ban placed on the 2013 project after Evil Dead Rise reached soaring heights and keeps pulling in incredible numbers. And regardless of the initial ban, there’s no discounting the fact that every entry in the blood-splattered franchise is a sure-fire hit that leaves the entire world stunned.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomGalpajBbsPArZqhZaOqvaa%2BzZqrrqqRoXqpu9GrpqtlpJ2utXnWmqpmp6KetKq6wKWjsmWSlruvscNmoKdlY2K7osDIqKWsZZaWua2%2FjK6lnZ2iYsGpsYymoJyqn6iwsLzEaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
