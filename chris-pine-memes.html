They will definitely make you laugh.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>There's certainly a lot to worry about, darling, and actor <a href=#>Chris Pine</a> is practically an innocent bystander in the mess that is the Don't Worry Darling press tour. Let's break things down for a quick moment.</p><p>Director and actress Olivia Wilde and lead Florence Pugh are <a href=#>allegedly feuding</a> for a few reasons. Florence feels the film is wrongfully hyper-sexualized in its advertising, while Olivia is pushing for the film to highlight innate "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">female hunger</a>." Plus, Olivia was seemingly too concerned with her blooming romance with costar and worldwide superstar Harry Styles to fully attend to her directorial duties.</p><p>Not only that, but Olivia may have cheated on her ex, Jason Sudeikis, with Harry and allegedly fibbed about firing original "combative" star Shia LaBeouf ‚Äî who has been accused of "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sexual battery and physical and verbal abuse</a>" by singer FKA Twigs ‚Äî for the sake of Florence's on-set safety.</p><p>And Florence? She has been (possibly passive-aggressively) absent from vital press events over the course of the tour. We know, there is a lot of unconfirmed information.</p><p>To top it all off, the internet went berserk when a video from the 2022 Venice International Film Festival surfaced showing <a href=#>Harry spitting</a> in Chris's lap! OK, so that video <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was debunked</a>, but it gave everyone a laugh.</p><p>All of this for a Rotten Tomatoes score of 42 percent? It's tragic, really. But in the midst of the turmoil, we present you with a list of some of the best Chris Pine memes, because what's a PR nightmare without a good Twitter meme or two?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Spitting is mild compared to violent goat throwing.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>BREAKING NEWS HARRY STYLES THROWS GOAT ON CHRIS PINE AT VENICE FILM FESTIVAL!!!! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/A8ZzRXwK5B</a></p>‚Äî ally üß∏ (@bbyonlyangel) <a href=#>September 6, 2022</a> <span>Source: Twitter/@bbyonlyangel</span></figure><p>If you're asking us, this is the real, unedited video.
