One routine was so controversial for its time it altered the discourse about freedom of speech in the United States, and the debate it spurred went all the way to the Supreme Court. George Carlin might have died in 2008, but his words live on in the hearts and minds of millions, including some of the most influential comics working today.</p><h2 id=george-carlin-showed-the-power-and-depth-of-language><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>George Carlin Showed The Power And Depth Of Language</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I love words," he opened several bits with this phrase, and what would follow would be an analysis of everyday words and phrases that people use. Carlin would either rip the phrase a part bit by bit or play on the fact people have ridiculous uses for seemingly normal phrases. "We would like to pre-board the airplane, well what the f**k does that mean, to get on before you get on?" Sometimes he even did these bits with a hint of poetry, like his routine "Modern Man," or "Hair."</p><h2 id=his-material-was-both-low-brow-and-high-brow><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>His Material Was Both Low Brow And High Brow</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another reason Carlin's material remains so relevant is because it runs the gambit from intellectual to low brow. Carlin was not above fart jokes and bathroom humor, but he was also capable of poignant social commentary about the most pressing political issues of his time. In the same stand-up special, You Are All Diseased, he both gives the world a 5 minute set of fart jokes and just a few minutes later delivered one of his most famous lines, "They call it the American Dream because you have to be asleep to believe it."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Was George Carlin Worth When He Died?</a></span></p><h2 id=george-carlin-was-in-several-classic-films-and-shows><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>George Carlin Was In Several Classic Films And Shows</span></h2><p>While not necessarily related to his stand-up, fans of his comedy did follow the actor into his acting projects. The fact he was in so many classic films and television series endeared him to his fans. Titles with Carlin at his best include Car Wash which he co-starred in with his friend Richard Pryor, <a href=#>Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure</a>, Dogma, and The Prince of Tides. He was also Mr. Conductor in a few seasons of Thomas The Tank Engine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=george-carlin-39-s-comedy-was-oddly-prophetic><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>George Carlin's Comedy Was Oddly Prophetic</span></h2><p>So many of Carlin's routines aged well it was almost like he could see into the future. Before the Supreme Court leak of 2022, Carlin did a routine about abortion. Before the Covid pandemic, Carlin did a routine about germophobia. Before Occupy Wall Street, Carlin did a routine calling out the rich and powerful. Carlin was light years ahead of his time.</p><h2 id=he-inspired-numerous-comedians><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>He Inspired Numerous Comedians</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Check out George Carlin's Wikipedia page sometime and one will find an entire section dedicated to all of the comedians who cite Carlin as an influence. One of the most prominent was political satirist Jon Stewart, who inducted Carlin into the Comedy Hall of Fame. Other big names who were influenced by Carlin are Bill Burr, the late Mitch Hedberg, Bo Burnham, Chris Rock, and Jerry Seinfeld to name just a few.</p><h2 id=one-george-carlin-routine-started-a-dialogue-about-freedom-of-speech><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>One George Carlin Routine Started A Dialogue About Freedom Of Speech</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Carlin's most famous routine was "7 Dirty Words You Cannot Say On Television." The routine pushed the boundaries by pointing out how arbitrary and ridiculous it was to censor so many words that millions use in everyday conversation. However, the routine would eventually get Carlin into some legal trouble. Like his hero Lenny Bruce, Carlin was arrested for public indecency when he performed this routine. After a radio DJ aired the routine in New York, the Federal Communications Commission pressed charges and the case went all the way to the Supreme Court. In the case FCC VS. Pacifica Foundation the Court ruled that the FCC had a right to dictate what could and could not be said on live broadcasts. Many argue the case was a blow to freedom of speech, it also resulted in something called the "Carlin Warning" an entertainment industry term for the warning that performers get from networks about what can and cannot be said on a live show.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Ricky Gervais Easily Could've Gotten Canceled For These Brutal Jokes</a></span></p><h2 id=george-carlin-39-s-routines-were-relatable><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>George Carlin's Routines Were Relatable</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Carlin was a prominent advocate of freedom of speech and a prophetic performer, he was also good at observational and relatable humor. He has routines about everyday situations, one of his most famous is "Ice Box Man," where he vents to his audience about how much work it is to keep his refrigerator in order, something that Dads across the globe can relate to.</p><h2 id=his-material-aged-well><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>His Material Aged Well</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most of Carlin's routine aged like fine wine. They aged well not just because Carlin weirdly predicted many of the problems that society now faces, but because he was good at being direct, comprehensive, and apt. Comedians will be the first to admit that writing material that ages well is challenging, what is a hot topic one year is long forgotten the next. But Carlin was smart enough to use his craft to cover everything from observational humor to intense political commentary. His routines aged like they did because he covered all the ground he could, and his fans continue to adore him for it.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:<a href=#> These Stand Up Comedians Are Rising Stars Thanks To TikTok</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdnsBus8SoqaCdXZius7jIp2SsrJGjsW7Bz2aaqKWVmcZuv9Oio6VlmaK9sL7TmqWtZaSksaLFjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
