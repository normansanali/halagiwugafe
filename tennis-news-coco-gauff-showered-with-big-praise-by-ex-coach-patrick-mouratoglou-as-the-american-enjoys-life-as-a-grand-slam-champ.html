Gauff came back from a set behind to win her first major title in five years since turning pro. Now, as the American teen sensation gets all the praise for her achievement, Gauff’s former coach <strong>Patrick Mouratoglou</strong> has analyzed her win.&nbsp;</p><p>Mouratoglou has talked about the improvements Gauff made which eventually helped her win her maiden Grand Slam title. The Frenchman believes the biggest improvement Gauff has made is maintaining her composure even in the toughest situations. Mouratoglou, who has coached the likes of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Serena Williams</a> and Stefanos Tsitsipas has also claimed that Gauff cannot be compared to anyone else.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>“For me, the big difference that I see between the Coco of before and the Coco of today, is that she’s mentally more calm. She matured so much in the last two months. I’ve seen some big changes in her attitude on the court and the attitude is just a consequence of how you feel inside,” said the Frenchman in a video shared by him on Instagram.&nbsp;</p><p>Mouratoglou also recalled Gauff’s match against Caroline Wozniacki and how the 19-year-old did not give up despite losing the second set and being a game down in the third set. He claimed that he knew that the panic would kick in but was amazed to see the way Gauff made a comeback to clinch the game.&nbsp;</p><p>Also Read: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“He r***d me three times a day,” Former pro Angelique Cauchy comes out with a horrifying confession against childhood coach&nbsp;</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-patrick-mouratoglou-claims-coco-gauff-s-defense-is-the-best-in-women-s-game>Patrick Mouratoglou claims Coco Gauff’s defense is the best in women’s game</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Coco-Gauff.jpg><p>While analyzing Coco Gauff’s win, Patrick Mouratoglou went on to claim that the 19-year-old has the best defense in the women’s game and that she cannot be compared to any other player on the tour. He then said that this skill was something Gauff had from the start of her career but the panic would spoil all the work.&nbsp;</p><p>“And the way she moves and her ability to defend and bring so many balls back, which is by far the best of the women’s game and you can’t compare her with any single woman…But still, when panic was taking her she was unable to reach out to her fighting spirits. It was kind of leaving her, because the panic was taking over,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Patrick also credited Gauff’s current coaches Pere Riba and Brad Gilbert for instilling confidence in the youngster.</p><p>Notably, Mouratoglou worked with Gauff for a brief period (from April 2023 till the French Open) after she parted ways with Diego Moyano and requested the Frenchman to help her on the court, Gauff also trained at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mouratoglou’s academy</a> in France.</p><p>In case you missed!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK57056lp6GjYrumw9Jmmqibn2K0osHFn2SsoJ%2BssrOxw2auoqyYYq%2Bqs4ypqZqho5p6o8WMnq9mm5%2BWsKl5z5qrq6GToHquu9SrmK2nl6G8tnnArGStoJVirq6x0aKamqZdmruru9isZKWhlpp6or%2BMmmSgqpGjsW6%2Fy5qkZpuYlrqxew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
