I had great luck on a dating app. I was only on it for like maybe a little over a week and met Adam… We are madly in love and we just have a good time together.”</p><p data-characters=304 data-current-count=304 data-injectable=false>Adam is not a member of Bachelor Nation, as he works in sales and public relations for the fashion brand Greg Lauren, as well as models on the side. The two lovebirds have been together since early 2021,&nbsp;and they recently moved to Los Angeles together – could there be wedding bells in the future?</p><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=630 data-injectable=true>Due to the fact that she is in a happy and healthy relationship (which seems to be leading toward an engagement), fans of The Bachelor franchise have been wondering why Hannah shows up at the beach for this season of Bachelor in Paradise. If you are just as curious as we are, keep scrolling to see what we sleuthed out…</p><h2 id=h-why-is-hannah-brown-on-season-9-of-bachelor-in-paradise data-injectable=false>Why is Hannah Brown on season 9 of Bachelor in Paradise?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=566 data-injectable=true>The trailer for season 9 of&nbsp;Bachelor in Paradise&nbsp;(<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">which is set to premiere on Thursday, September 28</a>) hints at four former Bachelorettes showing up to the beach, ready to make a splash:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Katie Thurston</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Charity Lawson</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rachel Recchia</a>, and Hannah Brown.</p><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=302 data-injectable=false>While <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rachel Recchia is on Bachelor in Paradise to find love</a> this season, we quickly wrote off the other three women as contestants, due to the fact that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Katie is going to be on&nbsp;FBoy Island</a>&nbsp;this season, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Charity and Dotun are engaged</a>, and Hannah has a long-term boyfriend (as explained above).</p><p data-characters=145 data-current-count=447 data-injectable=true>That still leaves fans of The Bachelor franchise with one question: Why does Hannah Brown make an appearance on Bachelor in Paradise this season?</p><p data-characters=401 data-current-count=401 data-injectable=true>In the trailer, Hannah is seen arriving in Mexico with a date card, prior to cutting to the shocked contestants. For those who are unfamiliar, anyone who sets foot on the beach during Bachelor in Paradise brings a date card with them, ultimately giving them the opportunity to ask anyone in the house to go on a one-on-one date. Naturally, Hannah entering with a date card posed quite a few questions!</p><p data-characters=306 data-current-count=306 data-injectable=false>According to Reality Steve, former Bachelorette Katie Thurston appears on season 9 of Bachelor in Paradise to read a group date card, rather than look for love. It is assumed that Hannah (and Charity) will be doing the exact same thing, due to the fact that they are both in serious relationships already.</p><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=596 data-injectable=false>While this is the common assumption, you can never be too sure! To find out what Hannah Brown is really doing on the beach, be sure to catch new episodes of Bachelor in Paradise&nbsp;on Thursdays on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ABC</a>&nbsp;(beginning on September 28 after the series premiere of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Golden Bachelor</a>).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tNhmoKxlmJa7r63HZpmrp6ejerC6jKycmqufo3p6ec6fZJuZk52yrbvRZqCnZaCWv6KwyKycaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
