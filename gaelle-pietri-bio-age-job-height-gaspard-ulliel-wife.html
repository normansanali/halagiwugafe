However, they never walked the aisle. So, though many may have labeled Gaelle to be Gaspard’s wife, she isn’t.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The duo announced their first pregnancy back in November 2015, and three months later they publicized the birth of their first child, Orso.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Yes, the same child that was featured in Gaelle’s video days before the actor was killed on slopes. In case you missed it, the couple took their little angle to ski on the mountain, on his sixth birthday (i.e. on Jan 12, 2022).</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Unfortunately, their passion for skiing was that brought misfortune upon them.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The two-time Cesar-winning actor, Gaspard (who wasn’t wearing a helmet) was rushed to a hospital after suffering a head injury during skilling on Jan 18, 2022. Reportedly, he was transported by helicopter to a hospital in Grenoble following a collision with another skier on the slopes in the Savoie region.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The other skier wasn’t seriously injured and an investigation was underway into the tragic accident.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>According to the mountain police, this was the first accident recorded that year (and it was just Jan). They shared that a skier just crashed into a 5-year-old girl and she died on the spot, three days before Gaspard faced the tragic accident.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>After Gaspard’s death, French Prime Minister Jean Castex led tributes to the actor, stating, “Gaspard Ulliel grew up with cinema and cinema grew with him. They loved each other madly.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>And he was right! This talented actor was nominated for a Cesar Award for “Most Promising Actor” in 2002 and 2003 and he finally won it in 2004. Also, fast forward to 2017, he won the Cesar Award for “Best Actor” for his role </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>It’s Only the End of the World</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><h3><b>Gaelle Pietri Age</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Gaelle Pietri is a 80s kid.
