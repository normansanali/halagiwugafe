Kenneth, who has a troubled criminal history, has had fans questioning why Nicki would be with him in the first place.</p><p>Despite his tainted record, Nicki has continuously defended her husband.</p><p>In 2018, Nicki addressed the haters by responding to a comment on a Twitter post mentioning Kenneth's past rape conviction. As commenters went in on Nicki’s husband (then boyfriend), the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rapper responded</a> by saying, “Y’all can run my life. Y’all can’t even run y’all own life.”</p><p>While the two went on to tie the knot, divorce rumors began swirling in 2024, leading many to believe she might be getting divorced.

The rapper said on the June 21 episode that the two had gotten the paperwork to legally wed.</p><p>"We did get our marriage license," she said. "I think I have what I was striving for, just happiness. It was so hard to get to a happy place. Now that I’m there, I don’t want to compromise that for anyone or anything."

On Sept. 30, 2020, the couple welcomed their son who she often refers to as "Papa Bear."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Barbie (@nickiminaj)</a></p></figure><p>Nicki sparked some possible elopement rumors when she referred to Kenneth as her "husband" on the radio show. While Nicki said that she had gotten the license back in June, it wasn't filed until late July. The pair were spotted at the Beverly Hills Courthouse on July 29 getting their marriage license and went on to officially tie the knot in October 2019.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Barbie (@nickiminaj)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Divorce rumors began flying in June 2024 after Nicki Minaj posted a cryptic message on Twitter.</h2><p>Although things to seem be going quite well in the Petty household, Nicki threw <a href=#>her fans</a> for a loop after tweeting "Yes Single..." on June 10, 2024. While some grew concerned that she might be referring to her current relationship status, others believe she was merely referring to a new single she's preparing to drop. What further fueled divorce speculation is a video Nicki shared to her Instagram Stories hours after of her reminiscing about the birth of her son, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Newsweek</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Yes<br>Single …</p>— Nicki Minaj (@NICKIMINAJ) <a href=#>June 10, 2024</a></figure><p>While Nicki didn't immediately address the rumors, fans are hoping for an update from the "Big Foot" singer.

Kenneth is a registered sex offender, as he was convicted of the attempted rape of a 15-year-old (he was also 16 at the time). Nicki said that Kenneth was in a relationship with the girl he was accused of assaulting.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Kenneth also was sentenced to 10 years in prison for a manslaughter charge. The charge came after he shot and killed someone, but he pleaded guilty and served four years of the sentence.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Who has Nicki Minaj dated?</h2><p>Nicki has certainly had a string of public relationships (and breakups) that have made her journey toward marriage a long and troubled one. She dated <a href=#>rapper Safaree Samuels</a> for 14 years, and the two officially ended things in 2014. The two later had a Twitter argument, during which Nicki claimed she paid for Safaree to get hair plugs.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Soon after, Nicki began dating another rapper, <a href=#>Meek Mill</a>, but they split in 2017 after dating for two years. Her relationship with Meek Mill also contributed to the end of her long-term friendship with <a href=#>Drake</a>. The pair collaborated on several songs together, but haven't since she dated Meek.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuusicoqJlnZ67oraMppirqpmasQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
