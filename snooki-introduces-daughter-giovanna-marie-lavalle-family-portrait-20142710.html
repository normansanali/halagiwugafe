The images feature <a href=#>a slim Snooki</a> cradling her tiny newborn daughter who’s fast asleep in her mother’s arms. The little tot wears a blush pink frock with a matching floral headband, as she rests her head against her beaming mother’s chest. Older brother Lorenzo, meanwhile, adorably pouts in his father’s arms.</p><p>The family portrait session also included some lovey-dovey shots of Snooki and her fiance enjoying a few minutes alone. The parents welcomed their second child on Sept. 26, announcing their happy news via Twitter. “Full head of black hair and perfect,” gushed the Jersey Shore alum.</p><p>Snooki coincidentally stopped by <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a>‘</strong>s headquarters on Monday to discuss motherhood and more. “Giovanna just turned one month yesterday,” she told <strong>Us</strong>. “It’s going by so quick! I feel like I just had her yesterday. But you know it’s kind of easy with two kids now because she’s a newborn — all she does is eat and s— and sleep. So she literally just lays there while Lorenzo — who is 2 — has temper tantrums. I think once Giovanna starts to actually move and crawl and run around, that’s when s—‘s gonna hit the fan.”</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=494 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Snooki and Giovanna" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>In a separate update posted to her website on Monday, Snooki also discussed her upcoming wedding to LaValle. “Obviously my wedding is on the show and that is coming up very very soon and I’m kind of freaking out about it,” she confessed. “I’m not getting cold feet but it’s really scary. Not that it’s scary that I’m going to be with Jionni for the rest of my life but it’s a scary day because everybody is looking at you and we are having so many guests!”</p><p>A clearly-motivated Snooki has been actively hitting the gym ahead of her wedding. Last week, the reality star posted an Instagram video of herself doing repeat sets of burpees with her trainer. “4 weeks post partum doing burpees. Jesus take the wheel,” she wrote. “@anthonymichaelfit #sheddingforthewedding.”</p><p>The final season of Snooki & JWoww, her Jersey Shore spin-off show with best friend Jenni “JWoww” Farley, premieres Nov. 5 on MTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaspp%2BkuKp5yKerq6eUqrCmv4ydmK6fmKmys3nGoqavmZ6jrm65wKugnmWclsOiuMueZJ%2BZnZ65unnPqKmtqpGewW5%2Bj2pra29hZXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
