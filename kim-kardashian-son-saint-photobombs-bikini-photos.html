By the fourth photo, she looked defeated with her hands over her face. The last image showed her floating on her back right after taking the splash into the water, knowing that her attempts to get the thirst trap did not go as planned. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt a girl get a good solo pic pleaseeeee,‚Äù the mother of four humorously captioned the carousel.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>It‚Äôs not clear where the photos were taken, but Kim shared several pictures and videos of her and Saint in Japan the day prior. First, they enjoyed an<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> immersive exhibit</a>, and then Saint seemingly had the time of his life while watching Saudi Arabia‚Äôs Al-Nassr team take on France‚Äôs PSG. Saint even met France‚Äôs Brazilian-born soccer icon, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Neymar</strong></a>!</p><p lang=pt dir=ltr>A rea√ß√£o de Saint West, filho de Kim Kardashian e Kanye West, ao ganhar uma camisa do Neymar. ü•∞<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#FutebolNaESPN</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>üé•: Instagram/kimkardashian <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/dvhz2dfAuR</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>‚Äî ESPN Brasil (@ESPNBrasil) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>July 25, 2023</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Kim shouldn‚Äôt be too shocked she was photobombed, considering she‚Äôs surrounded by kids most of her life. Just three days ago, she shared a a picture of herself <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>standing in a pool with Saint</a> in one arm, and her youngest daughter, 5-year-old <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Chicago</strong></a>, in the other! She didn‚Äôt seem to mind, though, as she got a nice kiss on the cheek from her son. She captioned the picture, ‚ÄúSweet Kisses,‚Äù showing she was happy with the adorable display of affection.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kardashians </a>star was successful with a thirst trap a week ago, and took to Instagram to share it. The photo, which can be seen <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>HERE</a>, showed her lounging in a black triangle bikini top and white snake print bottoms. She rested on a white chair on a balcony that overlooked the water.
