Now, Cannon could’ve exploded with anger or embarrassment or completely ignored the situation altogether but instead, he decided to take the high road.
On Wednesday (January 22), the Power 106 radio personality addressed Brown’s statements in a lengthy Instagram post and urged people to have sympathy for Brown."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But then after putting a little cognitive effort and analytical thought to the situation,I figured what a great opportunity for a “teachable moment”! First off let me say I am praying for the young brother Orlando even though I don’t really know him personally, I have always loved and enjoyed his talent and have been a fan of his past work. He was fucking brilliant in Major Payne, and had us all laughing on “Thats So Raven”. But this is another crucial example of when we allow our young artists to be prematurely exposed by this demonic business and left out to fend for themselves. We need better support systems for our youth and take care of our own. I watched various of this young brothers videos and all I see is a cry out for help. So I don’t know if there are any real leaders or solid individuals in this young man’s life but let’s embrace him and tighten him up so he doesn’t become another lost victim to these hollywood circumstances. I indeed believe this brother has the God given talent to be on Wildnout but this definitely ain’t the way to audition, this actually hurts my heart to see that we have allowed Orlando, along with various other young gifted performers we grew up loving, to just dwindle away after these corporations made their billions off of them. Now due to substance abuse and diagnosed psychiatric disorders our loved ones are now aimlessly begging for the attention they were once given , instead of the help they actually need. All while we sit back and just laugh… The most irresponsible parties involved in all of this is our media, specifically the “culturally conscious”. For us to continue to post slander and tear one another down for click bait to make these white supremacy propagated platforms more money is asinine and deplorable. These cannibalistic tactics only destroy “Us”. Really, in post like this, who wins??? We might chuckle, joke, pass the gossip on through our low frequency vibrations but does it truly make you feel good??? Especially knowing that there are higher powers looking down at you. So I hold @iheartradio @complex @worldstar accountable!…</a></p><p>A post shared by <a href=#>NICK CANNON</a> (@nickcannon) on Jan 22, 2020 at 1:27pm PST</p><p>The <a href=# rel=noopener>Wild ‘N Out</a>host, who has been famous for most of his life as well, empathized with Brown’s plight and admitted Brown’s situation has him feeling a bit emotional.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“I don’t know if there are any real leaders or solid individuals in this young man’s life but let’s embrace him and tighten him up so he doesn’t become another lost victim to these hollywood circumstances,” he continued. “I indeed believe this brother has the God given talent to be on Wildnout but this definitely ain’t the way to audition, this actually hurts my heart to see that we have allowed Orlando, along with various other young gifted performers we grew up loving, to just dwindle away after these corporations made their billions off of them.”</p><p><a href=#>Cannon</a> wrapped up the post by imploring people not to just sit back and do nothing.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“Now due to substance abuse and diagnosed psychiatric disorders our loved ones are now aimlessly begging for the attention they were once given , instead of the help they actually need,” he said. “All while we sit back and just laugh… The most irresponsible parties involved in all of this is our media, specifically the ‘culturally conscious.’ For us to continue to post slander and tear one another down for click bait to make these white supremacy propagated platforms more money is asinine and deplorable.</p><p>“These cannibalistic tactics only destroy ‘Us.’ Really, in post like this, who wins???
