Their initial date was set for February 13.</p><p>“With everything going on, we didn’t want anyone to feel pressured or worried about attending our wedding,” Compono, 28, told Us exclusively the following month. “It is supposed to be a celebration. We have so many friends and family, it was impossible for everyone to feel comfortable and we didn’t want people to have to make the decision to come or not. We decided that we would postpone until 2022 when things are hopefully better by then.”</p><p>She continued, “It was a really hard decision. I have been finalizing so many things with my planner, <a href=#>Kristin Buonaiuto</a>, and crossing my fingers things would blow over soon. But I think we made the right decision. I also want to send positive vibes out to all my other brides, because it’s a really hard thing to go through!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/The-Challenge-Jenna-Compono-and-Zach-Nichols-Are-Officially-Married-02.jpg><p>Compono and Nichols, 33, <a href=#>dated on and off after meeting</a> while competing on The Challenge: Battle of the Exes 2 in 2014.
