The fifth season last premiered on November 21, 2017.</span><p><span>For the show, another couple was shown three potential homes they may consider buying in central Texas.&nbsp;All houses need to be repaired and renovated.&nbsp;Joanna Haines designed it, at the couple’s option, with her husband as the prime contractor for the work.&nbsp;The buying couple typically has a budget of around $200,000, with a minimum of $30,000 estimated for renovations.</span></p><p><span>Joanna Gaines is said to have a design that tastes inch by inch simple and fresh yet timeless.&nbsp;She uses industrial pieces and has a specialty in making old things new.&nbsp;Above all, she is admired for seeing potential in projects, no matter how hopeless they may seem.</span></p><h2><strong><span>your parents and siblings</span></strong></h2><p><span>Joanna Gaines is of mixed ethnicity. Her mother, Nan Stevens, is Korean, and her father, Jerry, is half Lebanese and half German.&nbsp;Joanna is a Native American.&nbsp;Her parents have been married for over 45 years and Joanna Gaines has pointed to their relationship as a powerful inspiration for her own marriage.</span></p><p><span>While growing up, Joanna got a strong interest in business while helping her father run his tire shop.&nbsp;The couple only had three daughters, so Gaine’s only siblings are her sisters – one named Mary Kay McCall and the other Teresa Criswell.&nbsp;The designer has been working on a house for her sister, Mary Kay, which appeared on the fifth season of the Fixer Upper show.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Joanna’s husband, children and divorce</span></strong></h2><p><span>Joanna Gaines appears to be very happily married to Chip Gaines with no divorce on the horizon.&nbsp;They tied the knot in 2003 and have been partners in the truest sense of the word ever since.&nbsp;They had actually both attended Baylor University but had never met each other at school.&nbsp;The first time they met was at Joanna’s father’s house after Chip’s car had a brake failure.&nbsp;They were soon together and in love.</span></p><p><span>Every couple has their rough times, rumors of divorce crept in long ago when Chip Gaines momentarily left the business for a Spanish immersion program in Mexico.&nbsp;He was there for three months and during that time Joanna Gaines had sole responsibility for her business.&nbsp;However, the rumors were never confirmed and have since died down.</span></p><p><span>Together they have five children named Emmie,Duke, Ella, Drake and Crew.&nbsp;Crew Gaines, her current last birth, was born in June 2018.&nbsp;With her large family, it’s not surprising that Joanna Gaines not only runs her business, but also lives a simple life on the farm where she relaxes.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiin5a7r62MoJiippWoeqO1zmacraCenrCqwNhmmKCdXZi1qrjDq5ynZaCWv6a606xkrKGSobavs9Jmm6Kun6ewpns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
