Ethnicity, Nationality, Family, Education</span></h2><p>Ayydubs entered the world on November 17, 1995, in Providence, Rhode Island. She’s a Scorpio and a quarter of a century old. She has U.S. citizenship. She was also given the name Alyx Weiss at birth.</p><p>No one knows who Alyx’s parents are or what their names are. Contrarily, she is the youngest of four sisters: Jamie, Sam, and Zoe. Her mother, an oncologist, and hematologist, is also a native New Jersey resident.</p><p>At the moment, Alyx and her family are based out of West Los Angeles, California. Ayydubs also loves New Hampshire because her uncle owns a lake house there. She also went back to the house twice a year when she was a kid.</p><p>Alyx is a huge fan of the Sarah Silverman program “I Love You, America” which can be viewed on Hulu. She also looks up to Sarah Silverman for her humor and intelligence.</p><p>Ayydub watches every episode of this smash hit American TV show. She also has a large collection of socks, which she seems to find strangely comforting. She also hopes to one day direct and create her television shows and spend significant time in a foreign country.</p><p>No information is available about Ayydub’s academic background or credentials, nor about the schools where she has or is presently enrolled. Given her age, she must have finished both high school and college unless she is a dropout or decided to stop attending classes.</p><h2><span id=Quick_Facts>Quick Facts</span></h2><table style="width:80%;margin:0 auto" class="table table-striped facts"><tbody><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Full Name:</th><td style=height:24px>Alyx Weiss</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Born Date:</th><td style=height:24px>17 Nov, 1995</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Age:</th><td style=height:24px>26 years</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Horoscope:</th><td style=height:24px>Scorpio</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Lucky Number:</th><td style=height:24px>7</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Lucky Stone:</th><td style=height:24px>Garnet</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Lucky Color:</th><td style=height:24px>Purple</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Best Match for Marriage:</th><td style=height:24px>Capricorn, Cancer, Pisces</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Gender:</th><td style=height:24px>Female</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Profession:</th><td style=height:24px>Youtube Star, Instagram Star</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Country:</th><td style=height:24px>USA</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Height:</th><td style=height:24px>5 feet 2 inches (1.57m)</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Marital Status:</th><td style=height:24px>single</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Net Worth</th><td style=height:24px>$322K</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Eye Color</th><td style=height:24px>Brown</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Hair Color</th><td style=height:24px>Brown</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Body Size</th><td style=height:24px>34-26-34 inches</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Birth Place</th><td style=height:24px>Providence, Rhode Island</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Nationality</th><td style=height:24px>American</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Siblings</th><td style=height:24px>Three sisters (Jamie, Sam, and Zoe.)</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span id=Is_Alyx_Weiss_Single_Relationship>Is Alyx Weiss Single? Relationship</span></h2><p>At present, Ayydubs looks to be single and focused on her job and YouTube channel. Or maybe she just wants to keep her romantic and/or personal life private.</p><p>When considering her past relationships, there is also a lack of data regarding her current or former boyfriend. Therefore, it’s safe to assume that Ayydubs is either single and has never been in a relationship or is very good at hiding the fact that he has.</p><h2><span id=How_tall_is_Alyx_Weiss_Weight_Hair_Color>How tall is Alyx Weiss? Weight, Hair Color</span></h2><p>Ayydubs have a height of 5’2″ and a weight of 55kg. Her other measurements (bust, waist, and hips) are also standard: 34-26-34 inches. Her eyes and hair are the same shade of brown.</p><h2><span id=How_did_Alyx_Weiss_start_her_Professional_Career>How did Alyx Weiss start her Professional Career?</span></h2><p>Ayydubs’s discontent with her existence drove her into the world of social media. Like you, she found endless entertainment in the world of online video and yearned to launch her channel.</p><p>She also had a passion for cosmetics and apparel, leading her to swiftly create a YouTube channel under the name “ayydubs.” She uploaded her first video to her channel on April 18, 2009, and as of now, it has 172,647,220 views. In 2012, she also had her first clothing haul appear online.</p><p>Ayydubs struggled for the first three years of her channel’s existence to determine what kind of videos to upload. However, she developed a passion for comedy much later in life. She then started filming comedic videos and got the gist of the genre in no time.</p><p>Her channel on YouTube currently includes vlogs, how-to videos, comedic sketches, and more. As a bonus, Ayydubs’ storytime videos are full of humiliating incidents and uncomfortable situations that most people would rather not discuss.</p><p>This quality helped her gain subscribers and become more popular on YouTube. Shortly after, she started a web series called “Filming with My Tinder Date,” in which she talks about the dates she’s had through the “Tinder” app.</p><p>Ayydubs realized the series’ potential after realizing not everyone is willing to try ‘Tinder’ dates. In a similar vein, the show chronicles her spectacular, hilarious, and humiliating dates on the dating app Tinder.</p><p>Also Read, <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Viggo Sorensen</a>, <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Avivasofia</a>, and <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Giselle Guilmette</a>.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>YouTuber</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Leonardo Brugnara</a></h3>Leonardo Brugnara estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
