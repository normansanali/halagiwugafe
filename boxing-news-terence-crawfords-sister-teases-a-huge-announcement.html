However, the highly-anticipated fight has always failed to materialize due to various reasons. Both fighters have shown their eagerness and the fans have been demanding it for years. However, despite all this excitement, the fight has failed to come to fruition. Due to this a lot of fans have lost their faith in the fight ever taking place.</p><p>However, it seems that fans may yet have some hope for the fight. Recently, Terence Crawford’s sister <strong>Latisha Crawford</strong> posted a teaser that stirred up the boxing community once again. Crawford’s tweet resonated with the desires of boxing fans as they waited in anticipation of the fight.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>Latisha Crawford’s tweet teasing a huge announcement</strong></h2><p>With how huge the fight is, it is inevitable that even slight news regarding the fight will have everyone’s notice. Recently, Terence Crawford’s sister took to Twitter to tease a potentially huge announcement that would shake the whole boxing world, possibly even more than <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><strong>Ryan Garcia</strong></a> vs <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><strong>Gervonta Davis</strong></a>. Latisha Crawford recently posted a picture of an emoji of a woman biting her nails. In the caption she wrote, “I’m just ready for them to announce this damn fight“.</p><p>Being Crawford’s sister, it can be assumed fairly that she must have some insider information about the current status of the fight. And her saying that she is “just ready” is possibly a big sign of something brewing up behind the scenes.</p><p>Last month ESPN’s <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Mike Coppinger revealed that the duo was in talks, trying to salvage the fight</a>. After that, Dallas Morning News also revealed that the talks of the fight had restarted.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Boxing fans rejoice: Spence Jr and Thurman in negotiations for the summer fight</h2><p>According to Showtime’s <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><strong>Stephen Espinoza</strong></a>, negotiations are currently underway for a summer undisputed welterweight fight between champion Errol Spence Jr and Terence Crawford. Espinoza stated that he is “optimistic” that the fight can be negotiated and if not, Spence could potentially face former WBA/WBC welterweight champion, <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><strong>Keith Thurman</strong></a>.</p><p>Thurman, who possesses excellent promotional skills, hasn’t fought since last year but if he works as hard marketing a fight against Spence as he did for his 2019 bout against <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><strong>Manny Pacquiao</strong></a>, it could create massive interest.</p><p>Espinoza confirms that “99%” of the reports on the Spence vs. Crawford fight are inaccurate and there is no date set yet, but talks are ongoing. If the undisputed fight can’t happen,</p><p>Espinoza believes that the Spence-Thurman fight would be an excellent rivalry for boxing fans to watch. Ultimately, both fighters want the contest and are actively engaged in negotiating for the summer.</p><p><strong>Watch This Story: <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><span>Terence Crawford Knockouts: 5 Times ‘Bud’ Annihilated His Opponents</span></a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue8Gor6Kml2K7psPSZqueqpWjsKZ5wquYsJ6fp7G0edKiqq2domLBpq3SnqpmmV2dwqixjJqlp6elo7CmucSnq2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
