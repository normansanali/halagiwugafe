If you're unfamiliar with this gloriously girl power day, Knope explains it herself:</p><p>"Oh, it's only the best day of the year. Every February 13th, my lady friends and I leave our husbands and our boyfriends at home, and we just come and kick it, breakfast-style. Ladies celebrating ladies. It's like Lilith Fair, minus the angst. Plus frittatas."</p><p>Leave your significant other at home for waffles with your best friends. Raise a mimosa to the accomplishments of the ladies in your life. From work promotions to starting businesses to having a baby to gaining ten new followers on Instagram, whatever the reason, there is always an appropriate reason to hype up the ladies you love. This Galentine's Day share it with the world and include a funny caption.</p><h2>“You know my code: hoes before bros.
