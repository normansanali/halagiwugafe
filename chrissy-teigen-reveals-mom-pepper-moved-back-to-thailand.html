During a Tuesday, January 23, appearance on Sirius XM’s TODAY radio show The Happy Hour, Chrissy, 38, revealed that her mom, Vilailuck “Pepper” Teigen, recently moved back to Thailand.
“We miss her. So much. She’s only been gone for a couple of weeks, but you feel the void,” Chrissy said.
While it’s hard to say goodbye, Chrissy noted that her mom is “young enough that she needs to go off and be happy” and is “meant to go live her best life."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

And she needs to go find love and find, you know, whatever she wants. She pretends that she doesn’t care about that kind of stuff, and she just cares about her grandbabies and her friends, but I wanted that for her.”</p><p>Chrissy, who plans to visit her mom with Legend, 45, and their kids “every spring break,” admitted that the change didn’t really “hit” her until right before her mom left.</p><p>“I had not shed a tear. I was really excited for her. And then I heard ’30 minutes till your car gets here’ and then I just lost it,” she recalled. “I believe that there’s a spiritual and physical connection [with mothers]. And I felt it in my bones when she left, I really did.”</p><p>Chrissy is also adjusting to the reality of parenting without Pepper’s help.</p><p>“I truly haven’t really been on my own,” she confessed. “It’s weird waking up and going, ‘Oh, my God, I <a href=#>got four kids</a>, and mom’s not here.’ And, of course, we have help, but there’s nobody like your mother.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Although Chrissy said that she hadn’t “really told the world or the internet” about her mom’s move yet, Pepper has begun sharing photos of her life in Thailand via social media.</p><p>On Thursday, January 25, she shared a series of <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram photos</a> with the geotag Korat, Thailand.</p><p>“Home sweet home ❤️❤️❤️,” one commenter wrote.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacoKKewLTFjK2cop%2BVo3qzsdWemKWrXaK8rnnPnqepnaJiurDCxJ1km5mToHq1u4ytn5qhnJa7pXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
