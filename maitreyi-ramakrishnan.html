She is a Canadian citizen. Similarly, Maitreyi comes from a Tamil family in Sri Lanka. She does, though, register as a Tamil Canadian. Ramakrishnan was also born and raised in Mississauga, Ontario.</p><p>Ram Selvarajah is her father’s name, and Kiruthiha Kulendiren is her mother’s. Her father is an information technology specialist, and her mother works in marketing. Similarly, she has a sibling called Vishwaa Ramakrishnan. Her family is also of Hindu Tamil descent from Sri Lanka. However, her relatives migrated to Canada as refugees after the civil war in Sri Lanka. Similarly, Maitreyi has claimed that she identifies as Tamil Canadian rather than Sri Lankan owing to the war’s effect on Sri Lankan Tamil civilians.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurement</h2><p><strong>Maitreyi stands 5 foot 7 inches tall and weighs 60 kilograms.</strong> Her body dimensions are 34-26-35 inches for her chest, waist, and legs. Similarly, she has a lovely body and a stunning smile. In addition, she has black hair and black skin.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Maitreyi-Ramakrishnan-1.jpg><h2>Maitreyi Ramakrishnan Net Worth And Social Media</h2><p>Similarly, Maitreyi maintains a high activity level on all of her social media pages. She has 1.1 million Instagram subscribers, 36.9K Twitter followers, and 3264 Facebook followers. She uploads a number of photos to her Instagram account.</p><p><strong>In terms of earnings, her net worth is projected to be</strong> <strong>$0.2 million as of December 2023.</strong>&nbsp;Her primary source of revenue is her acting work.</p><h2>Professional Life, Career & Living Style</h2><p>In Grade 10, Maitreyi Ramakrishnan started participating in school plays. She was most likely a comic book enthusiast who aspired to work as an animator for comic book creation. Last year at Meadowvale High School, though, she changed her mind. She landed the lead of “Never Have I Ever” less than a year later.</p><p>Maitreyi has postponed her admission to the theatre program at York University in Toronto. She had decided to attend in the fall after graduating from high school so she could film “Never Have I Ever” in Los Angeles.</p><p>In the Netflix rom-com series “Never Have I Ever,” Maitreyi plays Devi Vishwakumar. Mindy Kaling picked her out of 15,000 people who qualified for an online casting call for the show in 2019. She even made her audition tape at a nearby library using her mother’s camera.</p><p>She was eventually requested to submit four more videos before being invited to a screen test in Los Angeles and being given the part. Ramakrishnan was just 17 years old when she was cast. And she hadn’t even worked or behaved properly. Her casting, on the other hand, drew a lot of interest in the media, especially in Canada. She attracted particular interest because of the essence of the free casting call and her Tamil Canadian name.</p><p>In addition, Today called her one of eighteen “Groundbreakers” in 2019. It was a list of women who were knocking down walls and creating a difference in the country. Her success in the show has got a lot of constructive feedback. Furthermore, the majority of the reviewers praised it as a “breakout success.” Similarly, Ramakrishnan narrated the Children’s Programming section of the 8th Canadian Screen Awards in 2020.</p><h2>Boyfriend & Dating</h2><p><b>Who is Maitreyi Ramakrishnan’s Boyfriend? </b><span>Maitreyi Ramakrishnan might be single right now. Maitreyi is currently more concerned about her work and education than about being in an intimate relationship. Or maybe she prefers to hold her personal and marital life secret and does not want to share it in public. Furthermore, little detail about her ex-lovers is accessible while dwelling on her previous marriages. Similarly, Ramakrishnan has effectively maintained her previous relationship secret.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Maitreyi-Ramakrishnan-1-1-410x1024.jpg><h2>Facts</h2><ul><li aria-level=1>Maitreyi Ramakrishnan is a television actress best known for her role as Devi in the first Netflix series “Never Have I Ever.”</li><li aria-level=1>Critics lauded Maitreyi Ramakrishnan’s success, with Variety naming it a “breakout show.”</li><li aria-level=1>In the Netflix rom-com series “Never Have I Ever,” Maitreyi plays Devi Vishwakumar.</li><li aria-level=1>Mindy Kaling picked her out of 15,000 people who qualified for an online casting call for the show in 2019.</li></ul><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Actress</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGikmqGkp7K6tYyrmKaZm6e2tLTNmqVo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
