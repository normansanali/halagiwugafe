A smoothie bowl is a thicker smoothie, placed in a bowl and topped all your favorite toppings. A smoothie bowl is so filling! This <span><strong>Kissed by Sunshine DOLE Smoothie Bowl</strong></span> is made with Dole Frozen Fruit Blends, juice or coconut milk and topped with fresh strawberries, pineapple, kiwi, oranges, berries, and coconut shavings. You can add greek yogurt for extra creaminess and protein. Adding a touch of granola gives it that crunch and keeps you satisfied even longer.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Kissed-by-Sunhine-Smoothie-Bowl-13.jpg alt="Kissed by Sunshine Smoothie Bowl made with frozen fruits, juice or coconut milk, and topped with fresh fruits, coconut shavings, and granola.

I find that using frozen fruit removes the need for ice, which melts and makes the smoothie taste watery. Also, Dole uses sun-ripened fruit and vegetables that are picked at just the right time and frozen, so you get the ripest and most flavorful fruits.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Kissed-by-Sunshine-Smoothie-Bowl-8.jpg alt="Kissed by Sunshine Smoothie Bowl made with frozen fruits, juice or coconut milk, and topped with fresh fruits, coconut shavings, and granola.

I also tried the Dole Mandarin Sunshine Blend, which has pineapple, strawberries, and mandarin oranges. It’s a classic that everyone loves and is full of Vitamin C. This Kissed by Sunshine Smoothie Bowl has so many nutritional benefits.</li><li><strong><span>Choose your Favorite Liquid.</span></strong>&nbsp;You use less liquid in a smoothie bowl than you would in a smoothie because you want it to be easily eaten with a spoon. Think sorbet texture. &nbsp;You can use apple juice, orange juice, coconut milk, or almond milk. You can even use water! The apple and orange juices add some extra sweetness. You can also use unsweetened coconut milk which adds some creaminess.</li><li><span><strong><span>Add Greek Yogurt for a Protein Boost.</span>&nbsp;</strong><span>Greek Yogurt is a good source of protein. Adding greek yogurt gives the smoothie bowl a richer and creamier texture. It is completely optional and can be made without it. &nbsp;I have experimented with smoothie bowls with and without it and I love it both ways.&nbsp;</span></span></li><li><strong><span>Eat your Greens!&nbsp;</span></strong><span><span>You wouldn’t believe how easy it is to sneak in some baby spinach without anyone noticing. It ups the nutritional value significantly without altering the taste. &nbsp;Give it a try!&nbsp;</span></span></li><li><strong><span><span>Add your Toppings.</span>&nbsp;</span></strong><span><span>This can be the fun part! The sky is the limit on toppings. I love to chew my food instead of just drinking it, so the addition of coconut shavings, granola, and fresh fruit make it more filling.&nbsp;</span></span></li><p class=block-pinterest-cta__title>Pin this now to find it later</p><a href=# title="Share on Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class=wp-element-button data-postid=6314 data-pin-do=none data-social-network=Pinterest data-social-action=Pin data-social-target=https://www.modernhoney.com/kissed-by-sunshine-smoothie-bowl/>Pin It</a><ul class=wprm-recipe-instructions readability=2><li id=wprm-recipe-12167-step-0-0 class=wprm-recipe-instruction readability=2><p>In blender, mix Dole Fruit Blends and liquid of choice.
