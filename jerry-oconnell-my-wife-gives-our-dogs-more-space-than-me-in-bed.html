“I love my dogs. I sleep with them. But my wife lets our dogs get in the bed as well so I get about eight inches to sleep on. I could sleep on a balance beam,” the 43-year-old actor, who will host the AKC National Championship Presented by Royal Canin, quipped during an exclusive interview with Us."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I sleep with them. But my wife lets our dogs get in the bed as well so I get about eight inches to sleep on. I could sleep on a balance beam,” the 43-year-old actor, who will host the AKC National Championship Presented by Royal Canin, quipped during an exclusive interview with <i>Us.</i> “If you get up and go to the bathroom, that’s it. They take your space. You’re sleeping in the dog bed or you better get out the sleeping bag!”</p><p class=p1>During his chat with <i>Us</i>, the <i>Sliders </i>alum also opened up about his full house. “We have four dogs — a Great Dane named Holiday; Pirate and Pip who are German shepherds; and Phil, who is a Saint Bernard-Pyrenees,” O’Connell said of his canine clan. “My wife adopted Phil, Pip and Holiday here in Southern California on adoption websites. Phil came from a breeder up in Ventura. They all get along. They are all great. It’s just so fun. They are such a part of our family.”</p><p class=p1>The <i>Stand by Me </i>actor teased that his dogs may be more fun than his and Romijn’s 8-year-old twin daughters, Dolly and Charlie. “A lot of the times,<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp; </span>I like our dogs more than I like our children,” he joked. “They are just more fun. They’ve never yelled at me. We also have two cats that we adopted from local shelters.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>O’Connell said that his affection for animals stemmed from the couple’s upbringing. “I had a dog growing up. It was really my wife who was all about animals, and animals are a big part of her family,” he explained. “She felt that animals should be a big part of our family. I’m a strong believer in it and why I love being a part of the AKC National Championship Presented by Royal Canin.”</p><p>The AKC National Championship Presented by Royal Canin will air on Animal Planet January 1 at 7 p.m. ET.</p><p class=p1><i>Reporting by Nicole Pajer</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajnaKnxm67wqilp52coXquxYywoJ%2BdXZy2t7HSZqauql2ZvKi%2FjKamq51dqL2ir8Rmq6GZnmK6pnnIp2SbnZRk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
