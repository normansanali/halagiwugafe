Jessica is on her way to trial – Harvey tells her she needs to cancel and go see Reynolds, but she refuses to bail on Leonard Bailey. Jessica tells Harvey that if he cares so much – he should go meet with Reynolds.</p><p>Harvey heads to Reynold’s office, he learns that the reason they are shopping around for a new law firm is because they heard that Harvey intentionally tanked Sutter’s case and they can’t have someone defending them who is not loyal to their clients. Harvey heads back to the office in a huff – he learns from Louis that another client is threatening to drop them because of the Sutter case too.</p><p>Rachel heads home after her and Jessica’s first stressful day in court. Mike gives her a pep-talk, he seems to have some helpful insight now that he has been through court and prison.</p><p>Louis’s girlfriend Tara shows up at the office and she drops a bomb on him – she is pregnant. Louis is thrilled, and then she reveals that it’s not his, it’s his ex-boyfriend Adam’s baby. Louis has an epiphany, he doesn’t care, he promises to raise Tara’s baby as if it were his own.</p><p>Harvey tracks down Jessica, he tells her that she needs to go to Reynold’s next board meeting. He explains that Sutter is telling everyone he tanked the case. Jessica is going to take care of Reynolds, but she tells Harvey that he needs to shut Sutter up.</p><p>Harvey shows up at Sutter’s front door. He tells Sutter that he needs to repair his reputation and get the other clients to stop dropping him. If he doesn’t, then Harvey is going to make sure that his house is repossessed before he gets out of prison.</p><p>In court the next day, Mike convinces Jessica to let Leonard Bailey take the stand and tell his story for the jury. Rachel is surprised when Jessica has her question Leonard, she does an impressive job – and Leonard’s testimony is moving, they may have a chance of getting his case thrown out after all.</p><p>Later that night, at home, Mike congratulates Rachel on her job in court. Rachel is going through her case files and she has an epiphany – she realizes that the victim’s father, Forrester, who testified in court, is hiding something.</p><p>Late at night, Stu [the stockholder] pays Louis a visit. Apparently his firm is bailing on them too and is going to back out of the lease and leave the office.</p><p>Rachel and Mike head to Forrester’s house at night – they accuse him of sending Maria [the witness] away so that she couldn’t testify against Leonard years ago. Of course, Forrester denies their allegations. After, they head to Jessica’s office and tell her what they did, and what they suspect, she of course freaks out – Mike and Rachel could have just blown the entire case.</p><p>And, there’s more bad news. Donna tracks down Harvey and tells him that Reynolds called the office – they have moved the board meeting that Jessica is supposed to go to, to tomorrow. If she doesn’t show up, they will lose their client for good.</p><p>The next day Harvey and Louis track down Jessica at court – they were calling her all night.

If Maria hadn’t skipped town, Leonard wouldn’t have been convicted. With forrester’s confession, the judge has no choice but to exonerate Leonard – he’s a free man and Jessica and Rachel are victorious.</p><p>After court, Robert is waiting for Jessica in the hallway, he congratulates her on her win. Then he makes a shocking offer, he wants Jessica to merge with his firm to save her company. Robert admires that Harvey tanked his Sutter case to save Mike, and they have done so much for his daughter Rachel.
