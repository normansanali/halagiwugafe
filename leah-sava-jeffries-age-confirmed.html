No, her casting as Annabeth Chase <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wasn’t well received by everyone</a>, but that’s neither here nor there. What matters is that Jeffries is continuing to carve her own space in the industry, playing roles that fit her like a glove.</p><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=281 data-injectable=false>As more and more people get used to seeing her on screen, some start wondering exactly how old Jeffries is. Too often we see <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">actors portraying characters that are much younger</a> or older than them, so it’s only natural for folks to question. Could this be Jeffries’ case?</p><h2 id=h-how-old-is-leah-sava-jeffries-now data-injectable=false>How old is Leah Sava Jeffries now?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians-annabeth.jpg><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>According to her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb page</a>, Leah Sava Jeffries was born on Sept. 25, 2009. Thus, by doing some quick math, we can conclude that the actress is currently 14 years old. This isn’t at all a big age difference compared to her character in Percy Jackson and the Olympians, who is 12 at the beginning of the series, so fans can rest easy.</p><p data-characters=213 data-current-count=551 data-injectable=false>If all goes well, Jeffries still has a long career ahead, which means that audiences should probably expect to see her in more projects as she grows older.
