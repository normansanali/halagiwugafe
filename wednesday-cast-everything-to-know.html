Shortly after its record-breaking release in November 2022, the series was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>renewed for a second season</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Tim Burton</a>, the director behind fantasy-horror hits like The Nightmare Before Christmas and Corpse Bride, brought his signature eerie vision to the characters created by cartoonist Charles Addams. The series follows the Addams Family's daughter, Wednesday, as she enrolls in Nevermore Academy, a prestigious school for "outcasts, freaks and monsters," as the fictitious academy's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>website</a> reads. It's also the place where Wednesday's parents — Morticia and Gomez Addams — first fell in love.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to an acclaimed director, the series also has an all-star cast, featuring a mix of A-list stars, up-and-coming actors and even an Addams Family alum.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For the show's lead, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jenna Ortega</a>, stepping into the role of Wednesday was a no-brainer. "People have been telling me I look like her since I was six years old," the actress told PEOPLE. "And I have a pretty dark sense of humor!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From where you've seen their faces before to their off-screen dating lives, here's everything to know about the cast of Wednesday.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-jenna-ortega-as-wednesday-addams></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Jenna Ortega as Wednesday Addams</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Gregg DeGuire/WireImage ; Netflix</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jenna Ortega, 20, was already one to watch before taking on the titular role in Wednesday, but the series has undoubtedly catapulted the actress' career to new heights.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, there was almost a reality in which Ortega didn't play Wednesday Addams. In March 2023, she told The Times U.K. that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>she originally "passed" on the role</a> several times.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I had done so much TV in my life. All I've ever wanted to do is film…You have to prove yourself. It's only in the last three or four years that I've been able to start going up for film," she explained. "I was scared that by signing on to another television show it could prevent me from doing other jobs I really wanted and cared about."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Prior to Wednesday, Ortega was best known for her role as Ellie Alves in the second season of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>You</a>, but she actually got her start as a child actress. The California native portrayed young Jane on Jane the Virgin from 2014 to 2019 and was later cast as Harley Diaz in Disney Channel's Stuck in the Middle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to her TV roles, the young star has also amassed several film credits to date, appearing in Netflix's Yes Day and The Babysitter: Killer Queen, as well as HBO Max's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>The Fallout</a> in 2021 alone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Even before the release of Wednesday, Ortega was already establishing herself as a scream queen. She played Tara Carpenter in the fifth installment of the Scream franchise, a role she revived in Scream 6. She also appeared in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>A24's X</a>, playing the girlfriend of an adult film director in the 1970s-set indie slasher.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In Wednesday, Ortega became the latest actress to take on the character created by cartoonist Charles Addams, bringing a whole new side to the death-obsessed little girl previously played by stars like Lisa Loring and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Christina Ricci</a>. Ortega took preparation for the role seriously — she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>told W Magazine</a> that she learned to play the cello, studied German and even trained herself not to blink.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"One time, I did a take where I didn't blink at all," she recalled to the publication about how she and director Burton developed her take on Wednesday's signature scowl. "He loved it so much that he gave me the note to not blink again. If I did blink, we'd restart the take."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One of the most captivating moments of the series occurs when Wednesday attends her high school dance at Nevermore and performs a gothic dance to The Cramps' "The Goo Goo Muck." The scene quickly became a fan-favorite thanks to Wednesday's eccentric moves, which Ortega later revealed she came up with herself.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I choreographed that myself!" Ortega <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told NME</a>. "I'm not a dancer and I'm sure that's obvious. I'd gotten the song about a week before and I just pulled from whatever I could … it's crazy because it was my first day with COVID so it was awful to film."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-catherine-zeta-jones-as-morticia-addams></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Catherine Zeta-Jones as Morticia Addams</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Gilbert Flores/Variety via Getty ; Vlad Cioplea/Netflix</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Catherine Zeta-Jones</a>, 53, takes on the role of the family matriarch, Morticia Addams.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Academy Award winner started as a child actress in London's West End, appearing in musicals like Annie and Bugsy Malone. She then appeared on the British television series The Darling Buds of May, which aired from 1991 to 1993. After relocating to Los Angeles, Zeta-Jones became a household name with leading roles in films like The Mask of Zorro (1998), Entrapment (1999), Traffic (2000) and Chicago (2002), the latter of which she won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actress returned to television in 2017 for the first season of Ryan Murphy's anthology series Feud in the role of Olivia de Havilland. She then had a recurring role in season 2 of the Fox drama Prodigal Son in 2021 before making her streaming series debut in Wednesday.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Zeta-Jones <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>told InStyle</a> that she set out to create a new version of the iconic character in the Netflix series. She focused on crafting Morticia as a modern mother dealing with many of the same issues as any parent with a teen — albeit with the added supernatural aspect.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's really Wednesday's story. I'm hoping that they continue with Wednesday's story forever, so I can grow old playing Morticia," she said. "I mean, nothing would make me more happy than to be 80 years old and still playing Morticia."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In real life, Zeta-Jones is a mother of two children, Carys and Dylan, whom she shares with her husband of 22 years, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Michael Douglas</a>. Dylan, 22, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>accompanied his mother to the L.A. premiere of Wednesday</a>, where the actress gushed to PEOPLE about the support her children have shown her.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Both my daughter and Dylan have been so incredibly supportive to me, not just as an actor, but just me, you know," she said of their "very close relationship."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I've been extremely blessed to be able to have both in my life," she added.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The following month, Zeta-Jones <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>compared Carys to the character Wednesday</a>. On Dec. 22, 2022, the actress shared a throwback video of her daughter wearing a black and white top at a school event and glaring off-screen.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Carys, my real daughter as a little girl. 🤣," Zeta-Jones <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>wrote in the caption</a>.

Before playing Gomez, the Puerto Rican actor was best known for his role as Raoul "El Cid" Hernandez in HBO's Oz, as well as his appearance in films like Boogie Nights (1997), Punch-Drunk Love (2002) and Traffic, where he first acted alongside his future TV wife, Zeta-Jones.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During an appearance on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Rich Eisen Show</a>, Guzmán shared how he was cast in Wednesday, revealing that he was approached by Burton personally and that the director offered him the role without an audition.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Guzmán agreed immediately, but he was sold even further on the project after reading the script for the first time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I got the script. I read it. The writing is ... you know, the thing about this Addams Family, it's not about slapstick. The writing is so good, it's so funny. The delivery, and it makes it funny. That's really what sold me," he explained.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for his personal life, Guzmán has been married to his wife, Angelita Galarza-Guzmán, since 1985.

He previously appeared in Disney's A Wrinkle in Time (2018) and a handful of indie and short films, though the Netflix series was the young actor's breakout role. However, as Ordonez <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>told J-14</a>, he wasn't nervous "at all" to step in the shoes of such a well-known character.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I just went in blind," he explained, adding that he wanted to add a "funny" element to Pugsley. "I just went with it and created him."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-76 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He was able to glean some inspiration from his TV big sister as well. "She did a really, really fantastic job with Wednesday. She really nailed her character," Ordonez said of Ortega. "Wednesday is a more serious character, but she still has comedy in her, which is Jenna."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-christina-ricci-as-marilyn-thornhill></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-78 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Christina Ricci as Marilyn Thornhill</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Gregg DeGuire/WireImage ; Netflix</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-80 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Joining the cast of Wednesday was a full-circle moment for Christina Ricci, 43, who previously played the titular character when she was 10 years old in 1991's The Addams Family.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-82 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actress reprised her role as Wednesday again in 1993 for Addams Family Values before going on to star in several '90s hits, such as Casper and Now and Then. Ricci then went on to appear in more than a dozen films, including The Opposite of Sex (1998), Sleepy Hollow (1999) and Monster (2003).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-84 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She also broke into TV, appearing on ABC's short-lived series Pan Am in 2002 and producing and starring in Lifetime's The Lizzie Borden Chronicles.

When asked about passing the reins to Ortega, Ricci <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told Elle</a> she was thrilled to see the young actress take on the iconic role.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-88 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I loved being Wednesday," Ricci said. "I'm very proud of that role. I also think Jenna Ortega is amazing. She is so brave, so cool, and really doing the part justice. Wednesday is her part now ...

She welcomed her son Freddie, 8, with her ex-husband <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>James Heerdegen</a> in 2014. Ricci later filed for divorce from Heerdegen in July 2020. In August 2021, the actress revealed she was expecting her second child, her first with her now-husband, hairstylist Mark Hampton.
