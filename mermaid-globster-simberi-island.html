Hoyt added: “It will have been dead for weeks or longer.”</p><p>Jens Currie, the chief scientist of the Pacific Whale Foundation in Hawaii, agreed that the mermaid globster could be a dugong. “My best estimate is that it might be a dugong,” Currie told <a href=# rel=noopener>Live Science</a>. Currie believes that the creature’s head looks too large to be a dolphin or whale. “[T]he amount of blubber also indicates a marine mammal and not a shark,” he explained.</p><p>Other experts agreed that the mermaid globster appeared to be a mammal, but stopped short before declaring it a dugong —&nbsp;or anything else.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-458936 alt="Mermaid Globster From The Side" width=720 height=324 data-sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/mermaid-globster-from-the-side.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-458936 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>New Irelanders Only/Facebook</span><span class=caption-body>Experts aren’t sure if the mermaid globster is a dugong, whale, dolphin, or even a shark.</span></p><p>Helene Marsh, an environmental scientist at James Cook University in Australia, suggested to Live Science that the mermaid globster was an unspecified marine mammal. Sascha Hooker, a marine mammal expert at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, similarly speculated the mermaid globster was a “very decomposed cetacean [a marine mammal like a whale or dolphin]” since their bodies turn white after their skin falls off.</p><p>One expert floated the idea that the mermaid globster could have been a shark, but others thought that the shape of the creature’s tail, flippers, and spine weren’t very shark-like.</p><p>Marsh, who is supports the mammal theory, told Live Science that it’s impossible to be more specific. “After that it is anyone’s guess,” she said.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-458957 alt="Globster Of Simberi Island" width=450 height=1000 data-sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/globster-being-carried.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-458957 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>New Irelanders Only/Facebook</span><span class=caption-body>The Simberi Island globster is not the only strange creature to wash up on shore in recent years.</span></p><p>And, indeed, it’s difficult for experts to make an educated guess about the mermaid globster without more data. That data — including DNA samples and measurements — is impossible to attain because locals on Simberi Island have since buried the mermaid globster.</p><p>The mermaid globster of Simberi Island is hardly the only unusual creature to wash up on shores in recent years. In 2008, the “<a href=# rel=noopener>Montauk Monster</a>” mysteriously washed up on the shores of Long Island, leading to speculation that it had been anything from an alien, to a mutant, to a raccoon (adding to the mystery, the creature mysteriously vanished). And in 2018, locals in the <a href=# rel=noopener>Philippines</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Russia</a> reported finding a giant, hairy globster on their shores.</p><p>It seems that we’ll never know for sure what the Simberi Island globster was. Maybe it was a dugong, whale, dolphin, or even a shark. Then again, maybe the strange thing was a mermaid. People on Facebook certainly thought so.</p><p>“Must be an old mermaid,” one commenter speculated, “came to the time of her passing, so must have died.”</p><p>After reading about the strange mermaid globster that washed up on Simberi Island, read about the world’s <a href=#>scariest sea animals</a>.
