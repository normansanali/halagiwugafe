People weren’t entirely sure what happened, but as she got older, she would eventually open up about her unique journey in Hollywood.</p><p>Let’s take a closer look and see why Mara Wilson retired from acting!</p><h2 id=she-was-a-massive-child-star>She Was A Massive Child Star</h2><p>For those that weren’t around to see, Mara Wilson was a fixture of the 90s, and she was a massive star long before she was even old enough to drive a car. It seemed like Hollywood could not get enough of the performer, and she wound up stacking up a list of impressive roles during this time.</p><p>In 1993, when she was just 6, Mara Wilson would make her movie debut in a little project called&nbsp;Mrs. Doubtfire. She would appear in the film alongside Hollywood heavyweights like Robin Williams, Sally Field, and Pierce Brosnan, and she was able to stand out in each scene that she appeared in. Even at 6, it was clear that the young performer had a natural gift for acting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From there, she would land a 5-episode stint on the hit series&nbsp;Melrose Place, according to&nbsp;IMDb. These were two huge projects in a short amount of time, and it helped get the ball rolling for the young performer.</p><p>She would continue her string of luck on the big screen with projects like&nbsp;Miracle on 34th Street and&nbsp;Matilda, which has maintained a massive following over the years. All of this occurred within a span of just 3 years, and the child star was everywhere. Not only that, but all these projects carried some degree of success.</p><p>Even though she was making big things happen in such a short amount of time, we would soon see the performer appearing in fewer projects, eventually reaching a point where she wasn’t taking part in anything. This got people curious as to why she seemingly disappeared from the business.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Moment Emma Watson Almost Quit Acting</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-quit-to-hollywood-s-body-obsession>She Quit To Hollywood’s Body Obsession</h2><p>Despite all of the success that Mara Wilson found in the early part of the 90s, things would taper off in a major way. Years down the line, the performer would open up about her experience in Hollywood, shedding some light on why it was that she had pulled a vanishing act.</p><p>Back in 2016, the performer would open up to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> about how the industry’s body obsession caused her to look at herself differently and how it impacted her desire to continue acting.</p><p>She would say, “I’ve had people tell me, ‘The way that you judge yourself, looks-wise, is on this really strange level.’ Well, it’s because I grew up in Hollywood. I had good experiences there, but I always knew there were girls much prettier than I was, and I knew that I was always competing with them. That has followed me my whole life.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She would follow this by saying, “Something didn’t make sense–at least until I was called for a role in a pilot. I would be auditioning for the ‘fat girl’.&nbsp;I realized, ‘I don’t fit their idea of what a Hollywood actress looks like, so there’s no room for me here.”</p><p>People outside of the business may not understand what these performers actually deal with, and it was nice to hear Mara’s side of things a few years back.</p><p>Eventually, however, she would make a return to performing.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Did ‘Entourage’ Star Adrian Grenier Quit Acting For Good?</a></span></p><h2 id=she-eventually-made-a-comeback>She Eventually Made A Comeback</h2><p>Having been out of the business for years, it seemed like Mara Wilson may never make a return. Eventually, however, she would start to take part in projects once again.</p><p>According to&nbsp;IMDb, Wilson has done some television work since her return. In 2016, she was in one episode of&nbsp;Broad City, and she followed this up with roles on&nbsp;BoJack Horseman and&nbsp;Big Hero 6: The Series. While they aren’t leading roles, it is still great to see Mara back in action.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>People have certainly taken notice that the performer has been a strong voice on social media, and she has made an appearance as herself on other shows and has been willing to open up and speak on a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">variety of things</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Is What Caused Brendan Fraser To Quit Acting</a></span></p><p>Mara Wilson retired due to the ruthless image machine of Hollywood, but she has been back and making things happen once again.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A Look Back At The Less-Than-Extraordinary Movie That Made Sean Connery Retire From Acting</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmpJqsmaGxonnSrZirZZ2Wv6J51qKjrKeeYr%2BmwMirnJ1llqe8rnnAnKuippdk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
