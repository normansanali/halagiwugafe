Tolman Professor of Theoretical Physics at the California Institute of Technology, he made a lasting impact.</p><p>Feynman was renowned for his ability to communicate complex ideas to the public.</p><p>His 1959 talk, “There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom,” on top-down nanotechnology, gained widespread attention.</p><p>He authored autobiographical books like “Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!” and “What Do You Care What Other People Think?”</p><p>His brilliance as a physicist and gift for inspiring others about science are celebrated in biographical accounts such as James Gleick’s “Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman” and Ralph Leighton’s “Tuva or Bust!”</p><h2><span id=Richard_Feynmans_Role_in_World_War_II>Richard Feynman’s Role in World War II</span></h2><p>During World War II, Feynman made significant contributions to nuclear technology within the Manhattan Project, a covert government initiative focused on crafting the atomic bomb.</p><p>His scientific expertise proved invaluable.</p><p>In 1941, Feynman worked on ballistics problems at Pennsylvania’s Frankford Arsenal.</p><p>Physicist Robert R. Wilson then invited him to join the Manhattan Project after the attack on Pearl Harbor, despite not having a graduate degree. Feynman’s talents were recognized by the project’s leaders.</p><p>Initially, Feynman worked on the isotron project at Princeton, aiming to electromagnetically separate uranium-235 from uranium-238 to produce enriched uranium for the bomb.</p><p>Practical challenges led to the pursuit of Lawrence’s calutron method at the University of California’s Radiation Laboratory based on Ernest O. Lawrence’s recommendations.</p><p>In early 1943, Feynman joined Hans Bethe’s Theoretical (T) Division at the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico.</p><p>Bethe promoted him to a group leader position for his intellect. They developed the Bethe-Feynman formula to calculate the bomb’s yield.</p><p>Feynman also managed the computation group, introducing innovative methods for logarithm computation using IBM punched cards.</p><p>Feynman’s dedication extended beyond his scientific role.</p><p>He actively participated in devising safety measures at the Manhattan Project’s uranium enrichment facilities in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, ensuring personnel understood the risks involved.</p><p>He also enjoyed investigating and cracking combination locks used by his fellow physicists, earning him a playful reputation.</p><p>Throughout the project, Feynman faced personal hardship as his wife, Arline, battled tuberculosis.</p><p>Despite the challenges, he remained committed to the Manhattan Project’s work.</p><p>Witnessing the Trinity nuclear test on July 16, 1945, where the first atomic bomb was detonated, marked a significant moment in Feynman’s pivotal role during World War II.</p><p>His brilliance as a physicist and unwavering dedication left an enduring impact on history.</p><h2><span id=FACTS_ABOUT_Oppenheimer_Film_AND_Richard_Feynman>FACTS ABOUT Oppenheimer Film AND Richard Feynman</span></h2><table><tbody readability=15><tr><th>Oppenheimer Film</th><th>Richard Feynman</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>Subject</td><td>A film depicting the life of J.
