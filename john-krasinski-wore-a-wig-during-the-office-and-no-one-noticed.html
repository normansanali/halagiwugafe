‘The Office’ Cast: Then and Now
It turns out, Krasinski wore a wig to cover up his shorter haircut, which he had done in order to act in the 2008 movie Leatherheads. Krasinski, now 40, sneakily bought his own hairpiece to wear when showrunner Greg Daniels denied his request to wear one altogether."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

[Krasinski] came in a little later that day, and I had the wig hidden in a little secret spot ready for him. When it was just him and I, I put it on him, and then he went out and filmed.”</p><p><a href=#>Costars Reunited</a></p><p>Krasinski would then meet with Daniels again — alongside producer <strong>Kent Zbornak</strong> and writer-actor <a href=#><strong>B.J. Novak</strong></a> — to try to convince him.</p><p>“Greg kept saying, ‘No! I would know if you’re wearing a wig.’ So John leaned over the desk and said, ‘No I don’t think you would.’ That’s when he ripped it off and shut it down, and we got to do the wig,’” Ferry recalled. “The first thing Greg said was, ‘Wow. You guys have balls,’ and then goes, ‘But I have to say I didn’t see that coming.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/John-Krasinski-Wore-A-Wig-During-The-Office-Season-3-And-No-One-Noticed-4.jpg><p>Krasinski played football player Carter Rutherford in the sport comedy, which also starred <a href=#><strong>George Clooney</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Renee Zellweger</strong></a>.

We were on a little show called The Office and it turned 15 years old this week. I was a waiter when I got that job, I was 23 years old. After the pilot, I went back to waiting tables because I was sure nothing was going to happen with it,” Krasinski said. “We all kind of came into it with that vibe. I remember none of us had done anything huge.”</p><p>Carell, 57, chimed in: “It’s such a happy surprise that after all these years people are still tuning in and finding it today, it’s pretty cool.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGooJ5iuLOt0qKlrKOZYsSwvsRmmGavmZx6pcHRoqWgZaSdsm67xZ%2BgnJ1dlrulec2oZKimlWK7sMDInJydZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
