(In fact, the last time they hit the red carpet as a couple was in 2012 for the film The Place Beyond the Pines, in which they both starred and during which they began their romance.) New details, however, about their parenting style and family life have emerged.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">An insider at <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/inside-ryan-gosling-eva-mendes-home-life-with-daughters/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Us Weekly" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Us Weekly</a> said, "They're hands-on parents and don't have any nannies. Being confined to their home with two small children is exhausting at times, especially without hired help."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Despite the tiring work of being a parent, family always comes first in the Mendes–Gosling household. "Eva has programmed her entire routine and career to ensure family comes first—then work fits in around it," a second source said to the outlet. "Ryan is protective of Eva and a very doting dad."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As a family unit, the couple and their two young daughters go to the park or the farmers' market in their downtime. They also enjoy reading, watching movies, and cooking together, and Gosling has a lot of fun in the kitchen with his kids. "That's his big thing," the second insider added. "He encourages everyone to do it with him. It's fun for the whole family."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Mendes echoed a similar sentiment when she responded to a fan on Instagram earlier this year. When asked if she and the La La Land actor cook together, she said, "Ryan is an amazing chef AND baker. For reals. Incredible. No joke. I'm not sure that what I do is cooking. It's more like steaming veggies and juicing and making rice."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The actress also previously spoke out about why she doesn't post intimate details about her family to social media. "My man and kids are private,” she told a fan on Instagram, adding that she only shares photos are already available online, per <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://pagesix.com/2020/03/06/eva-mendes-reveals-struggle-with-food-why-she-wont-share-new-photos-of-ryan-gosling/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Page Six" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Page Six</a>. “That’s important to me so thanks for getting that.”</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/1025b301-1f7f-4f4b-80fe-228ddf464aff_1642017719.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" title="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>As an associate editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, Chelsey keeps a finger on the pulse on all things celeb news.
