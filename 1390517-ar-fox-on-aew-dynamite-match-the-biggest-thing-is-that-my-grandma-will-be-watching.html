The biggest thing that matters the most to me is that I know she’s gonna be watching tonight.”</p><p>When asked whether he would make a signal to acknowledge his grandmother, Fox noted that he might wave his hand.</p><h2 id=h-ar-fox-on-signing-with-aew>AR Fox On Signing With AEW</h2><p>AR Fox also looked back on signing with AEW, and he recalled how he couldn’t believe it. Even now, eight months later, Fox stated that it still didn’t feel real.</p><p>“I couldn’t believe it was happening,” he said. “That was the thing, just seeing it, that it was a legit one, there’s all these different ways, but to see that I had this for some time, and it had me set up, I don’t know. I just kept thinking something was gonna get messed up or something was gonna get lost. I just literally couldn’t believe it. So even though it’s been almost eight months, I’m literally counting the days, since I’ve been signed, it still sometimes, I’m like, ‘This fight ain’t gonna come true this time. This can’t be real.’ Or just getting paid.</p><p>“I’m like, ‘Yeah, I got paid again.’ It might sound really silly, but I’m just not used to it. I’m like holy crap, I got paid again. I guess unbelievable is the best way to describe me signing it because all this stuff, even though I’ve been doing it for a while, it still seems almost too good to be true. I just can’t believe it. I’m grateful, I’m very grateful.”</p><p>WrestleZone will have coverage of the <a href=#>July 26 episode of AEW Dynamit</a>e as it airs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJyZ25pZ2Kus3nFqK9mp55irqbDjJ2wp5mdnsGmecyaq5ygXam1pnnBop6gnaOperW0yKeeZqGjYsGprdNmpLJll6eur7DMmmSwoZyheqOxjLCYrZuYnruo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
