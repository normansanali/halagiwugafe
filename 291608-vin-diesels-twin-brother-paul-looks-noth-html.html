They <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004874/bio>grew up</a> in an artist's housing complex in New York City's Greenwich Village.</p><p class=dh>They were brought up by their mother, Delora Sherleen, an astrologer and psychologist, and their father, Irving H. Vincent, an acting instructor and theater manager.</p><p class=dh>The twins' adoptive father is African-American, while their mother is Caucasian with English, German, Scottish, and Irish ancestry. Vin said he is "certainly a person of color," referring to his biological father's origins.</p><p class=dh>Besides recognizing Irving's race, the "Fast Five" actor also <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.thelist.com/446223/the-real-reason-vin-diesel-changed-his-name/>used</a> his step-father's last name as his on-screen name. "Vin" is a shortened version of Irving's family name.</p><p class=dh>Meanwhile, Vin's second nickname, Diesel, was a word play for diesel fuel. When he was a teen, his friends gave him the moniker because of his energetic personality.</p><p class=dh>Vin looks <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.ladbible.com/entertainment/celebrity-film-and-tv-vin-diesel-has-a-twin-who-looks-absolutely-nothing-like-him-20171027>nothing</a> like his brother.
