After the two were seen hanging out together at an EP release party for Ebony Riley in Los Angeles last week, rumors about Leo and Eden Polani began to circulate. Despite a snapshot showing Eden and Leo sitting next to one another, a source close to Leo told TMZ the two are not dating or in any way a couple.</p><p>After the two were spotted seated next to one another at Ebony Riley’s EP release party, romance suspicions quickly spread given DiCaprio’s penchant for dating younger women.</p><p>A source told TMZ just happen to have been seated next to each other at the party and was hanging in the same group.</p><p>“There is zero truth to this.

Leo clearly can’t be dating every single person that [he’s] in a room with.”</p><p>It is made clear by our source that Leo is not necessarily dating any girl just because they are sitting or talking together. After four years together, Leo split up with Camila Morrone, 25, last year.

A film source told PEOPLE at the time that the two “like each other and are having a nice time.” DiCaprio, who has known Gigi for years but only in a casual way, was “taken with Gigi,” the industry source continued. “She is the type of woman he is usually attracted to.”</p><p>According to our source, Leo is not currently involved in anything major.</p><p><a href=#>Gil Ofer</a>, the son of millionaire businessman Idan Ofer, who is 31 years old, was previously thought to be Polani’s latest alleged love interest. The couple gained notoriety last year after Gil, who had once dated Sofia Richie, shared pictures of them together on his Instagram Story. Due to her age, they had kept their relationship a secret.</p><p>The teenage model Eden was disclosed this week by Gil, the rich businessman Idan Ofer’s son, who uploaded a couple’s photo on social media. Because Polani was not yet “legal,” among other reasons, the two kept their relationship a secret after first meeting at Ofer’s birthday party.</p><h3><strong>Eden Polani Age</strong></h3><p>As of Feb 2023, Eden Polani is 19 years old.</p><h3><strong>What Is Eden Polani Date Of Birth?</strong></h3><p>Eden Polani’s date of birth is 21 March 2003.</p><h3><strong>Eden Polani Family</strong></h3><p>Currently, there is no information about Eden Polani’s family.
