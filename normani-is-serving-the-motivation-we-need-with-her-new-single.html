Normani delivers a fun and flirty chorus over a horn-filled beat which gives off plenty of nostalgic early 00’s vibes, whilst her soulful vocals shine throughout.</p><p>I’ma break you off, let me be your motivation<br>To stay and give it tonight<br>And, baby, turn around, let me give you innovation<br>Hey, ’cause I do it so right</p><p>In addition to the song itself, Normani has dropped the music video for ‘Motivation’, which really emphasises that she is multi-talented threat. Paying homage to a number of iconic music videos from the 00’s including Beyoncé’s ‘Crazy In Love’, ‘…Baby One More Time’ by Britney Spears and ‘I’m Real’ by Jennifer Lopez, the music video is incredibly slick and puts the focus on Normani as a sensational performer.</p><p>Serving phenomenal dance routines with jaw dropping looks to match, Normani snaps hard and shines like a true star. From gymnastic choreography to a striking sequence in the rain, there really is nothing that Normani can’t do. It’s hard to deny that she is an extremely exciting performer who is carving her own path in the music industry.</p><p>The visual also highlights the importance of visibility and representation in the industry. The opening scenes see a young Normani watching 106 & Park, and dreaming about seeing her own music videos on TV one day. Now, she’s living life beyond her wildest dreams and is without doubt here to stay.</p><p>Watch the music video for ‘Motivation’ below.</p><p></p><p>It’s safe to say that ‘Motivation’ has sent the internet wild, with fans and celebrities alike rushing to praise Normani’s fierceness throughout the song and visual. The likes of Lizzo, Halsey, Missy Elliott, Zara Larsson, Kehlani and Kelly Rowland are just a few who shared their adoration for the new Queen of bops.</p><p>Of course, with ‘Motivation’, Normani is once again only just scratching the surface and we couldn’t be more excited for whatever she has in store for us with her debut solo album. It’s been a long time coming, but what’s good is most definitely worth waiting for.</p><h4>Have you been jamming along to ‘Motivation’?
