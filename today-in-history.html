His success also marked the first time a non-Soviet had won the championship in 24 years.</p><h2>1985: The Wreckage Of The Titanic Is Discovered</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-380148 alt="Today In History September 1" width=900 height=630 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/today-in-history-september-1.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-380148 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Public Domain</span><span class=caption-body>The bow of the RMS Titanic.</span></p><p>A joint expedition between American and French oceanographers Robert Ballard and Jean-Louis Michel leads to the discovery of the wreckage of the <a href=# rel=noopener>RMS Titanic</a> on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean. The vessel was found 400 miles east of Newfoundland and 13,000 feet beneath the surface, 73 years after it sank.</p><p>The oceanographers used an unmanned submersible called Argo to explore the ocean’s depths. In the early morning hours of September 1, Argo came across one of the Titanic‘s boilers. Similar submersibles later explored the ship’s wreckage, recovering thousands of <a href=# rel=noopener>artifacts</a>.</p><h2>2004: The Beslan School Massacre Begins</h2><p>The <a href=# rel=noopener>Beslan school massacre</a> begins in Beslan, Russia. A group of armed Chechen terrorists took more than 1,100 people hostage at a local school. The terrorist group managed to herd the hostages into the school’s gym where they remained for the next three days. Eventually, the Russian government received word that a terrorist attack was underway and deployed troops to end the conflict. On the third day of the standoff, Russian forces stormed the building. In the storming, the school caught on fire and hundreds were killed or injured. In total, 333 people died in the siege, making it the deadliest school shooting in history.</p><h2>2009: Picher, Oklahoma Is Unincorporated And Evacuated</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Picher, Oklahoma</a>, America’s most toxic ghost town, is unincorporated and evacuated given evidence of serious health concerns.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony1u8OasGahnmK1qr%2FTqKmyZ6OavbWxzJucq2Vh</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
