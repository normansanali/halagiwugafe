While describing Gamora and Neytiri’s traits, the 44-year-old actress stated:</p><p>Differences, I think that Gamora is a lot more resolved with making, finding her inner peace. Whereas Neytiri finds herself in just chapter two of a very long journey with her anger and her inability to understand. Neytiri is not a voice of reason, she’s an instinct. She’s a force of instinct and gut. And that’s why her and Jake are absolutely just essential to each other. And he’s essential to her, and she leans on him for so much. Even while she is wrestling him on everything. And he has to have so much patience.</p><p data-characters=59 data-current-count=59 data-injectable=false>Avatar: The Way Of Water will debut in theaters on Dec. 16.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJosaidXaiurbDAp5hmqpWrsqK40maroZ1dpLumedOhoKefXZ2ys3nAr5itmaJirq%2BwjKaYq66VoXqiuMiepaxlmJbDpnnIp2Scp52ivK97</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
