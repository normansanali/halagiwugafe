A new image from the show was shared by Entertainment Weekly (via <a href=#>Collider</a>), and it gives us a small sneak peek into what we can expect from Mark Hamill’s character, Arthur Pym.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/mark-hamill-fall-of-the-house-of-usher-900x506.jpg><p><strong>Mark Hamill is a beloved actor known for his great work both on and off the screen, but his role in the upcoming <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=Netflix data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Netflix</a> TV series The Fall of the House of Usher looks to be much more sinister.</strong></p><p>In the first look image, Mark Hamill is seen wearing a buttoned-up coat, a striped tie, black gloves, and a fedora hat. He is standing outside in the rain as he talks on the phone next to a parked car. Judging by the expression on his face, it looks like he is involved in something ominous.</p><p>The Fall of the House of Usher is set to release all eight episodes on October 12, just in time for the Halloween season. The Netflix show will center around the Usher family, which is led by Roderick Usher, the CEO of a pharmaceutical company. The wealthy family will ultimately meet their demise in this limited series that looks to be a dark and twisted version of Succession.</p><p><strong>In addition to Mark Hamill, the new series will feature two other well-known stars from the <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=sci-fi data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>sci-fi</a> world, including Bruce Greenwood (Star Trek) as Roderick Usher and Mary McDonnell (Battlestar Galactica) as Madeline Usher.</strong></p><p>While Mark Hamill’s character is not a member of the Usher family, it doesn’t guarantee his safety. He plays Arthur Pym, the Usher’s family lawyer who is likely responsible for getting them out of some shady legal situations.</p><p>Outside his voice work for villains in animated series — most notably the Joker — it’s rare to see the <a href=#>Star Wars</a> actor take on the role of an unlikable or evil character, so it will be interesting to see how he pulls it off.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/fall-of-the-house-of-usher-900x506.jpg><p>The Fall of the House of Usher is a new Netflix series from Mike Flanagan, the horror director who has brought us other great TV shows like The Haunting of Hill House, The Haunting of Bly Manor, and Midnight Mass. Fans are easily drawn to the “Flanaverse” shows thanks to their gripping stories, great acting, and beautiful cinematography. If the new TV series goes well, hopefully, we will see even more innovative horror projects from the creative mastermind.</p><p>In addition to Mark Hamill, the new series will feature two other well-known stars from the sci-fi world, including Bruce Greenwood (Star Trek) as Roderick Usher and Mary McDonnell (Battlestar Galactica) as Madeline Usher. It will also feature several familiar faces from previous Mike Flanagan projects, including Carla Gugino as Verna, <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title="Henry Thomas" data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Henry Thomas</a> as Frederick Usher, and Kate Siegel as Camille L’Espanaye.</p><p><strong>While Mark Hamill’s character is not a member of the Usher family, it doesn’t guarantee his safety.</strong></p><p>The limited series The Fall of the House of Usher is based on the short story of the same name by Edgar Allan Poe. The new show looks like it will lean into the gothic style of the renowned author, as it uses the phrase ‘Nevermore’ throughout its trailer. At the same time, it looks like it will bring the horror story from 1839 into the modern century with clever jump scares and subtle humor.</p><p>Get ready to see Mark Hamill as you’ve never seen him before when The Fall of the House of Usher drops on Netflix this October.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ilkae4brTApqClpF2rtq24wKKlZqaVqbOttddnn62lnA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
