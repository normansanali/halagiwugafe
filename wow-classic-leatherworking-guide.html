Having to spend Gold in order to protect yourself is so pointless when you can just do it yourself. This is why Leatherworking is such a great profession to invest in, as it can help you learn how to use hides and leather to craft armor, armor kits, and more.</p><p data-injection=true>There are 300 levels you can progress through and by the end of it, you will be craft some great pieces of equipment. We have the steps you need to take to get to 300 in a breeze right here for you to make it even easier. We break down what items to make to help get through every level and what you will need to make them. The format is:</p><ul><li>(Amount & Crafted Item) – (Amount & Materials Needed)</li></ul><p data-injection=true>Before we get started, though, we want to recommend that you pair Leatherworking with Skinning and to level both professions up at the same time. Doing so will make it easier for you to get the needed leathers and hides to craft. You could buy them at the Auction House but that can get pretty expensive.</p><h2>Approximate Materials Needed</h2><p>First off, this is the list of all materials you will need over the course of leveling up all 300 ranks, as well as how many of each you will need:</p><ul data-injection=true><li>57 Ruined Leather Scraps</li><li>470&nbsp;Light Leather</li><li>275 Medium Leather</li><li>20 Heavy Hide</li><li>195 Heavy Leather</li><li>450 Thick Leather</li><li>475&nbsp;Rugged Leather</li></ul><h2>Leatherworking Trainers</h2><p>To begin your Leatherworking journey, you need to become an Apprentice, which can be done after reaching Level 5 and speaking with a Leatherworking Trainer. These are spread throughout the game and in every major city. If you need help finding them, speak with a City Guard and they will tell you where to look.</p><h3>Alliance Trainers</h3><ul data-injection=true><li>Randal Worth in Stormwind City.</li><li>Gretta Finespindle in Ironforge.</li><li>Darianna in Darnassus.</li><li>Nadyia Maneweaver in Teldrassil</li><li>Adele Fielder in Elwynn Forest</li></ul><h3>Horde Trainers</h3><ul><li>Kamari in Orgrimmar.</li><li>Dan Golthas in Undercity.</li><li>Mak in Thunder Bluff.</li><li>Chaw Stronghide in Mulgore.</li><li>Shelene Rhobart in Tirisfal Glades.</li></ul><h3>Classic Leatherworking (Level 1 – 75)</h3><h3>1 – 20</h3><p>19 Light Leather – 57 Ruined Leather Scraps</p><h3>20 – 45</h3><p>40 Light Armor Kit – 40 Light Leather</p><h3>45 – 55</h3><p>20 Handstitched Leather Cloak – 40 Light Leather, 20 Coarse Thread</p><h3>55 – 75</h3><p>50 Embossed Leather Gloves – 150 Light Leather, 100 Coarse Thread</p><h2>Journeyman Leatherworking (Levels 75 – 125)</h2><p data-injection=true>You will need to learn Jounreyman Leatherworking once you reach Level 75 to keep progressing.
