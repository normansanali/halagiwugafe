Many of Us have been fans for years, but recently, they’ve become increasingly trendy — solidifying their status as some of the most fashionable footwear in the game! While they’re seriously cute, their comfort level is unparalleled.</p><p>That’s precisely why we’re always bummed to stuff them into the back of the closet once summer ends. Luckily, Birkenstock solved this problem by updating the Arizona model with a shearling-lined treatment that’s made for fall!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Birkenstock-Arizona-Shearling-3.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Birkenstock Arizona Shearlin</a><a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">g</a> with free shipping for prices starting at <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">$125</a>, available exclusively at Zappos!</strong></p><p>These sandals have the same quality design that we’ve all come to expect from <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">a pair of Birkenstocks</a>. Most of the options available are made from suede leather, but there is also a plaid cloth version if you want a printed pair. They also feature the trademark cork sole that <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Birkenstock is known for</a>. It’s contoured to mimic that natural shape of your foot, which is what makes these shoes so relaxing and easy to wear!</p><p>Best of all, the shearling that lines <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">the sandals</a> gives these Birkenstocks a major upgrade that we need for chillier weather! It will provide your feet with the extra warmth they crave, and the fur will look adorable when you team these sandals with socks. If you don’t want to wear them outside, these sandals are perfect as everyday house slippers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Birkenstock-Arizona-Shearling.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Birkenstock Arizona Shearlin</a><a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">g</a> with free shipping for prices starting at <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">$125</a>, available exclusively at Zappos!</strong></p><p>Shoppers say they <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">love wearing these sandals</a> both indoors and outdoors, and they’re especially great for college kids who need a casual shoe to don around campus. They don’t fully look like slippers, but they’re definitely just as comfortable! One reviewer said that “the shearling is so warm without being hot,” which is exactly what we love to hear. Nothing’s worse than overheated feet, and apparently <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">these Birkenstocks</a> nail the ideal temperature that we’re looking for.</p><p>Who knew a pair of <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Birkenstocks </a>that was this cozy existed? We found them just in time! Now that it’s officially too cold to wear sandals into the wild, we’re thrilled these new Arizonas entered the chat. Even if we’re limited to using these sandals as slippers, we couldn’t be more excited to rock our Birkenstocks year-round!</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Birkenstock Arizona Shearlin</a><a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">g</a> with free shipping for prices starting at <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">$125</a>, available exclusively at Zappos!</strong></p><p><strong>Not what you’re looking for?
