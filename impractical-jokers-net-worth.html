We are organically best friends, you know. We’ve been doing this kind of ‘embarrassment’ humor all our lives and so when we created the format for the Jokers show… it just shows off our friendship in a really nice way.”&nbsp;<strong>– James Murray&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“Yeah, I mean there’s always the chance of it. And that kind of keeps us on our toes when we are filming the regular show. If we lose then there’s a real air of tension because most of the punishments are kept a secret from each other. And that day… the day of the punishments.”&nbsp;<strong>– Sal Vulcano&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“I have a problem with that day…. because that day we filmed two punishments back to back. We filmed me jumping out of an airplane and then went over to the cornfield to punish Sal. Two in the same day. And he goes on and on and on about how terrified he was. I fell 14,000 feet free-fall, not knowing if the parachute would open.”&nbsp;<strong>– James Murray&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“Q had introduced that game to us. It’s just so stupid to do it but one of the most terrifying feelings is when you are about to clip it onto someone. When you get caught – when you are a middle-aged man in a supermarket and they turn and look at you with judgment in their eyes! That’s one of the worst feelings!”&nbsp;<strong>– Joseph Gatto&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>3 Things to Learn From Practical Jokers</h2><p>Let’s look at some of the things we can learn from them now that you are fully aware of their success and net worth:</p><h3>1.
