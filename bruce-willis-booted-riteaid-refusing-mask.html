According to a report from Page Six, Willis was kicked out of a Los Angeles branch of the store after refusing to wear a mask while shopping.

LA County has reported over 12,000 deaths from the virus and there are tens of thousands of positive tests every day. With the city’s healthcare system at breaking point, things are looking grim. In one example of how serious it’s gotten, Disneyland is being turned into a large-scale vaccination center, which I guess still means it’s the happiest place in the world, but for a different reason.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bruce_willis_in_cosmic_sin-1.jpg><p data-characters=488 data-current-count=488 data-injectable=true>But even if this weren’t happening, Willis would still be a dick here. As a Hollywood A-lister, he’s no doubt already procured his vaccine through various means, but he’s continuing to put the workers in the store at risk through breathing out of his potentially COVID-19-laden breath. On top of all that, you’d think the virus has a big silver lining for major celebrities, as with everyone wearing masks, they’re far less likely to be recognized in public.</p><p data-characters=452 data-current-count=452 data-injectable=false>In any case, right now you can see <strong>Bruce Willis</strong> in two <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">absolutely terrible straight-to-VOD clunkers</a>. Hard Kill&nbsp;is a cheapo action flick and&nbsp;Breach&nbsp;stars him as a grizzled outer space janitor battling some kind of parasitic force. After the “Die Hard is Back” battery ad, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">many are hoping for the return of John McClane</a> for a sixth full outing, though now it seems that an appropriate title would be “Die Hard on a Ventilator.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomautk5p6uLXLpaCsZZKkvLWxw2apoqyVlraledGena6rmaO0brnArKJo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
