"If you take away this ability this control to out themselves you are forcefully putting them into a possibly violent household where their parents could kick them out, force them into conversion camps, or relinquish their parental rights and put them into the system and god forbid they might consider suicide," they said, adding, "Changing this policy would create a very slippery slope."</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>What is Parental Secrecy Policy?

Francis practices a polyamorous relationship style, where a person is allowed to share romantic feelings with multiple people at the same time in an open way. The activist reportedly grew up in the small town of Chico. During the board meeting last week, Francis said schools can often be the only place for children to discover their gender identity, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Daily Mail</a>. "I will speak loud for those who cannot speak, I'm a proud he, she, they, them, whatever I am a boyfriend to a beautiful woman, I am a girlfriend to a handsome transman, and I am also a girlfriend to an incredibly beautiful woman," they said.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Meet Squeaky Saint Francis who spoke at a recent Chico California School District meeting.</p><p>Squeaky argued in favor of a policy that would allow teachers to consult and help a child transition genders without the parent’s knowledge.</p><p>The board then voted to keep the “parental… <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/nH0UeNcilq</a></p>— Collin Rugg (@CollinRugg) <a href=#>April 13, 2023</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p>‘'Growing up in this town, my mother always told me to love myself for who I am not what I am not," they continued. "Not all of us can be as lucky and have a supporter like that. In fact, I knew friends in school who would bring an entire change of clothes with them so they could dress the way that they felt inside and be free of the persecution that they would feel at home or the sideways glances." They went on to say that they were one of the lucky ones who learned to "trust" in the process, but that not everyone had that at home.</p><p>"One of the first things we learn in a healthy family is trust and unfortunately some parents don't trust their children when they say this is me and they make that decision for them," they said. "That may make the child fearful of the people that claim to be trying to protect them. These children may see the hate and prejudice at home for people just like them and feel the only place they can be themselves is at school."</p><h2 class=split>Why Aurora Regino is suing Chico</h2><p>The board meeting was also attended by Aurora Regino, who is suing the Chico Unified School District, claiming her eleven-year-old daughter's school encouraged her to transition and officials kept her new gender a secret from her family.

The counselor ignored her request and did nothing to support her and let me know what was going on at school." She claims the Parental Secrecy Policy from California's Assembly Bill 1226 is damaging children’s minds. "It's incredibly damaging that they're upholding such a crazy policy for such young children," she told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Fox News</a>, arguing that such a tumultuous time in children and adolescents' lives is when they need parental guidance the most.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikeqq%2FjKyorp2RoMZuv8Cipa1llqeur6%2FIrGStqpGjwG6twq2gr6GjqXqprcilqmabmJ6wsL%2BMnZycoaOevK9506hkpJ2VpXqxrdGepa2ZnGLApq%2FRnpqyZaCkuaqv2A%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
