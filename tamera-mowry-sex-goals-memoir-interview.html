I always said, I wouldn’t write this memoir until I felt ready and here it is! I share with you all of my ‘Tameraisms’ defined as: A Tameraism is a bite-size drop of wisdom that can spark happiness, inspire change, and empower you to live your most delicious life,” she added.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>The philanthropist and activist also spoke out about how she’d like to see <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>more Black representation</a> in Hollywood; not only in front if the camera but behind, as well. “I feel like we need more Black representation, especially behind the camera. Things have gotten better in my 30 years in the industry. But we still aren’t where we need to be,” she said. “As a producer myself, I know the importance of Black representation in Hollywood because when I began acting, there were no roles for little Black girls. I open up about this in my memoir and discuss my journey and struggles facing racism as a child and an adult in Hollywood.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Tamera-Mowry-New-Memoir-shutter-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>In Tamera’s memoir, which was released October 4, the actress sheds her “good girl” image to empower other women to step up to life’s unexpected turns and surprised, and to make it all work.
