In the pic posted earlier this week, the actor, 47, stood in a swimming pool with his arms out to catch the toddler. The little one was at the edge of the water without a bathing suit.
While some of the Rampage star’s followers gushed over the sweet father-daughter moment, many had a problem with the upload."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Buuuuut one day when you have babies Allison you’ll understand the power of skin to skin.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The California native also shares Simone, 17, with his ex-wife, <strong>Dany García</strong>. <a href=#>The teenager graduated last month</a> and Johnson honored her&nbsp;with an Instagram tribute.</p><p>“And then your babies graduate,” he captioned the upload, which featured two father-daughter photos. Simone was all smiles in the first, wearing a blue cap and gown, but pulled away from her dad’s embrace in the second. “Very proud of my first daughter daughter graduating high school, kickin’ ass and is now NYU bound.&nbsp;I love you and one day you’ll stop pulling away from my beastly arms & kisses.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGatoJViv7CvymabnqSVqbK0ecOarKCgpJq%2FtHnPoppmr5mptbDB02aZmqyYnruoedKuoK1n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
