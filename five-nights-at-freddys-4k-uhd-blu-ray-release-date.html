Particularly if you are a fan of big franchises. The major release this past Halloween was <a href=#><strong>Five Nights at Freddy’s</strong></a>, based on the popular video game sensation of the same name. Now, after taking the box office by storm, Freddy Fazbear and his crew are making horror fans’ holiday season merry and bright with the film’s 4K and Blu-ray release.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Five Nights at Freddy’s will be released for purchase <strong>on digital on November 28 </strong>before scaring its way to <strong>4K, Blu-ray, and DVD on December 12</strong>. The release will be jam-packed with special features. This includes “Five Nights at Freddy’s: From Game to Big Screen”, “Killer Animatronics” — the film's <a href=#>animatronics</a> were all done <a href=#>practically</a> — and “Five Nights in Three Dimensions.”</p><h2 id=lsquo-five-nights-at-freddy-39-s-rsquo-capped-off-blumhouse-rsquo-s-stellar-2023>‘Five Nights at Freddy's’ Capped Off Blumhouse’s Stellar 2023</h2><span class=txt>Close</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the quality of Five Nights at Freddy’s will be debated until the adaptation's <a href=#>inevitable sequel</a>, the one thing you can’t argue is its massive financial success. Starting out as <strong><a href=#>Blumhouse</a>’s biggest opening in its history</strong>, it would go on to <a href=#>break a handful of records</a>, including the <strong>biggest debut for a horror film directed by a woman (Emma Tammi)</strong>. As it stands, the film <strong>has made <a href=#>$271.9 million</a><a href=#> worldwide</a> on a very small $20 million budget</strong> and still remains in the weekly top five.</p><p>This is all the more impressive when you consider that Universal made the questionable decision of putting Five Nights<a href=#>day-and-date on Peacock</a>. Although this is by far one of the most successful films to use this model, Universal definitely left money on the table as the home release fizzed out repeat theatrical viewings. Hopefully, when the sequel does happen, this <a href=#>release method will be as abandoned</a> as Freddy’s Pizzeria.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Also, while Five Nights was far from the best horror film of the year, it did a good job of being an effective gateway genre experience for younger viewers. Moviegoers particularly gravitated to the film, with it receiving an <strong>87% audience score on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotten Tomatoes</a></strong>. Was it as scary as the games? Absolutely not. However, the film’s great ensemble cast and Tammi’s commitment to the material made for a fun time at the movies. <a href=#><strong>Josh Hutcherson</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Piper Rubio</strong>, and <strong>Elizabeth Lail</strong></a> share such wonderful chemistry, but it’s <strong><a href=#>Matthew Lillard</a>’s return to horror that makes this film worth a watch</strong>. As genre fans well know, he “always comes back.”</p><h2 id=where-is-39-five-nights-at-freddy-rsquo-s-39-streaming>Where Is 'Five Nights at Freddy’s' Streaming?</h2><p><strong><a href=#>Five Nights at Freddy’s</a> is currently streaming on <a href=#>Peacock</a>, but it’s also still in theaters</strong>.

The terrifying horror game phenomenon becomes a blood-chilling cinematic event, as Blumhouse — the producer of <strong>M3GAN</strong>, <strong>The Black Phone</strong>, and <strong>The Invisible Man </strong>— brings<strong> Five Nights at Freddy’s</strong> to the big screen. The film follows a troubled security guard as he begins working at Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. While spending his first night on the job, he realizes the night shift at Freddy’s won’t be so easy to make it through.</p><strong>Release Date</strong> <span>October 27, 2023</span> <strong>Director</strong> <span>Emma Tammi</span> <strong>Cast</strong> <span><a data-id href=#>Josh Hutcherson</a> , Matthew Lillard , Elizabeth Lail , Mary Stuart Masterson</span> <strong>Runtime</strong> <span>110 minutes</span><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch on Peacock</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6G5qrDEq2Wcp51ks6rCxGalop%2BYqcBurdNmnaudlJnGtHmTpGSuoJRir63BjKuYsmWimrmmrdKeZJ2ZpJp8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
