He should have been the one doing all that "hyping," after all. In January 2022, it was rumored that the two had broken up. The pair has always been private about their lives, so neither of them has addressed the speculations. Here's the real status of their relationship these days.<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Megan Thee Stallion’s Record Label Sued Her For Doing This</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-is-pardison-pardi-fontaine>Who Is Pardison "Pardi" Fontaine?</h2><p>Born Jordyn Kyle Lanier Thorpe, Fontaine is a rapper from Newburgh, New York. He is also a father to a five-year-old daughter named Jordy Jr. The 32-year-old's stage name came from the 1985 film, Back to the Future. In a 2019 interview with People, he said that he first named himself "Pardi McFly," which was a spin on Michael J. Fox's character, Marty McFly. "Then, I thought to myself, 'JAY-Z is not going to do a song with somebody named Pardi McFly,'" he recalled. "So, I just dropped the McFly and I kept the Pardi."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fontaine also shared that he's been rapping since middle school. It started when he wrote a song with another student rapper. "He gave me this beat and I wrote a little verse to it and that was the first time I ever rapped," he said. "That was like, 'All right, I can do this.' That was my real intro." He released his biggest hit in 2018 but managed to stay away from mainstream music because he's a ghostwriter.</p><p>In 2019, The New Yorker wrote a profile on him as part of its story about ghostwriters in the music industry. There, it was revealed that Fontaine was the writer behind Cardi B's hit Be Careful from her album, Invasion of Privacy. The rapper once thanked him for the song. "My boy Pardison... I told him, 'I really want this record. I want it for me,'" <a href=#>the mother-of-two</a> told hip-hop radio host, Ebro Darden.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here’s Why Rihanna May Have Unfollowed Megan Thee Stallion On Instagram</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-timeline-of-megan-thee-stallion-amp-pardi-fontaine-s-relationship>A Timeline of Megan Thee Stallion & Pardi Fontaine's Relationship</h2><p>The couple's romance can be traced back to 2020 when Fontaine was named co-writer in the remix of Megan's popular track, Savage featuring Beyoncé. That year, he was also credited as a songwriter on the Real Hot Girl's hit collaboration with Cardi B, WAP. In February 2021, the Body hitmaker confirmed their relationship on Instagram Live. "I didn't like what they was trying to say about Pardi," she said at the time. "'Cause he is so calm and so sweet and very protective.… That's my boo and I really like him." She also clarified that she "never said hot girls can't have boyfriends. Yeah, he my boyfriend."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though he wasn't able to attend the Grammys with Megan in March 2021, Fontaine didn't hold back on expressing his admiration for his girl. "The girl can't be stopped," he wrote on his Instagram story. Two months later, they made their red carpet debut at the iHeartRadio Music Awards. In June that year, the two also had a cute PDA moment on the BET Awards red carpet. At the time, Megan also revealed that Fontaine makes her happy.</p><p>"First of all, he does make me happy, but my happiness comes from myself because I'm a happy lady. But like I said in the last interview, I got good energy around me right now," she told Houston radio show 97.9 The Box. "Everybody that's a part of my life, definitely makes me feel good, keeps me encouraged. I love where I'm at working and writing and with my music so that always puts me in a good mood whenever I figure out what I want to say in a beat. And yeah, Pardi does make me happy too."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Fallout From Doja Cat's Decision To Quit Music</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In November 2021, Fontaine went with Megan to the Glamour Woman of the Year Awards where she delivered an emotional speech. "I win a lot of awards as Megan Thee Stallion, but tonight I choose to accept this award as Megan Pete, a soon-to-be college graduate from Houston, a woman who has built a successful career in a male-dominated industry and musical genre, who has earned her respect from people that couldn’t look beyond my public persona," the hip-hop artist said to the crowd.</p><p>"I've naively trusted some wrong people at the wrong times and wound up in situations that were not beneficial to my well-being, I've been vulnerable and been taken advantage of," she continued. "But I've learned from each of those situations, and I've become a stronger woman as a result of them. I've persevered which, at the end of the day, is what really matters." In March 2022, Fontaine shared a fan-made Instagram reel of Megan's major accomplishments.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two are still going strong these days.
