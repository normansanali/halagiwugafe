The Legally Blonde actress ended up with a gash on her forehead in September 2011 after she was struck by a car while on a run in Los Angeles.
“The driver seemed to have not seen her because of a large tree at the intersection,” an eyewitness exclusively told Us Weekly at the time."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Witherspoon was later released from the hospital and went home to recover, while the 84-year-old driver was cited for failing to yield to a pedestrian in a crosswalk.</p><p>Nearly a decade later, <a href=#>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a> alum Mellencamp shared photos from her own injury.</p><p>“I gave 2020 the boot — and 2021 returned the favor!” the former <a href=#>Bravo personality joked in January 2021</a> via social media alongside a photo of her on crutches. Mellencamp twisted her ankle while playing pickleball with her family over the holidays.</p><p>She <a href=#>made light of the situation</a>, telling her followers, “The silver lining: it’s called a ‘dancer’s fracture’ so I’m basically a ballerina now. Pickle Ball: 1. Teddi: 0.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Mariska Hargitay</strong></a>, for her part, suffered two separate injuries in 2021.
