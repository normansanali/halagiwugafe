It became quite apparent our marriage was beyond reconciliation with Ms. Bellino’s Instagram post on Super Bowl Sunday. … My hope is that all adults involved can be considerate of the children Andrew and I share when taking to social media.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaroJ%2BYeqK41KZkmqSVrba0ecGeo6WhnqR6rrHErapmmp%2Bus7O1xKebZpmemcZurs6hpaxlm56xtHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
