If Edgar Wright and Marvel have anything to say about it though, the character will become a household name before long as according to Wright himself, the script for Marvel’s <a href=#><b><i>Ant-Man</i></b></a> is pretty much complete.</p><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=307 data-injectable=false>This news does not come as a shock. <i>Ant-Man</i> has been gestating for a long time now, even before the release of <i>Iron Man</i>. The reason for the delay is that director Edgar Wright opted to finish two films, <i>Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World</i> and the upcoming <i>The World’s End</i>, before turning his attention to <i>Ant-Man</i>.</p><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=562 data-injectable=true>It’s unsurprising that Marvel did not mind putting <i>Ant-Man</i> on the backburner. With a full slate of films on the dock, they could afford to wait. Now&nbsp;<i>Ant-Man </i>has been set for a November 2015 release date and Wright is readying himself for the challenge.</p><p data-characters=71 data-current-count=71 data-injectable=false>Here’s what the director had to say about the film’s current state:</p><p>&nbsp;The script is all done, actually. I put Ant-Man on the back burner to make [The World’s End] for a number of reasons, some of them quite personal – it was like, ‘I have to do this film now, it’s really important.’ And so [Marvel] were actually very good in terms of like, ‘OK, we’ll see you in two years.’ The things is, is that that character’s been around since 1962, so he’s not going anywhere, and the later we leave it the better the special effects will be.</p><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=288 data-injectable=false>With a completed script, <i>Ant-Man</i> will probably start casting soon. Armie Hammer was recently mentioned as a possibility for the titular role as the man who can resize himself at will, but that’s all rumor right now.</p><p data-characters=253 data-current-count=541 data-injectable=true>While I’m getting a little bored with all the superheroes invading our screens, <i>Ant-Man</i> sounds like an interesting and slightly weird concept. With a man like Edgar Wright at the helm, who specializes in the slightly weird, I admit to being intrigued.</p><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=210 data-injectable=false>We’re sure to hear more about casting and plot details for <i>Ant-Man</i> in the coming months and years prior to its release. It might be a long way to 2015, but Marvel tends to start teasing rumors far in advance.</p><p data-characters=87 data-current-count=297 data-injectable=false>Who would you like to see play <b>Ant-Man</b> in Wright’s film?
