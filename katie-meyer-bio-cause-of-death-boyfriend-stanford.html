She was found dead in a residential building a day before. The cause of her death hasn’t been released yet. Police suspected no foul play in her death and there was no threat to anyone else on campus.</p><p>Her family shared that they were ‘brokenhearted’ by her loss. Katie’s sister Sam Perez took to Instagram stories to honor her sister.</p><p>Also, Samantha wrote on her IG, “There are no words. Thank you for all the kindness extended to my family. I’m not ready to post anything big yet. We are broken-hearted and love Kat so much.” A GoFundMe page was started on behalf of Steve Meyer which has raised $62,968 as of this writing.</p><p>The Stanford Daily reported that students first noticed ambulance and polices vehicles near Crothers Hall at around 11 am. The school also released a list of grief resources available to students and others throughout the community. The school said in their statement, “We will grieve this loss together, and will be here for each other.”</p><p>Katie earned national recognition in 2019 after she made two critical saves to help the Cardinals win its third NCAA championship. When she made the second save in penalty she looked directly to the ESPN camera and acted like locking her lips and throwing away the key had gone viral.</p><p>Moreover, Katie had also sent the internet into a frenzy after allegedly trash talking at the semifinal game against UCLA. Speaking with Just Women’s Sports, she clarified that Mia (Fishel, UCLA player) shouted “We scored because of the keeper. It’s the keeper” and told her team she was the weak link which wasn’t super exciting for her to hear.</p><p>So, right before half-time, Mia took the penalty and which Katie saved. She explained, “Had any other player taken the PK, I wouldn’t have said anything. But she’d been talking, so I talked back. I asked her, “Is it the keeper? Is it the keeper?” I wish it had stayed on the field, but it didn’t. Mia’s a great player. I’ve known her for a while, and we’re competitive. We get heated at the moment, just like guys do. And we’ll play each other again.”</p><p>Furthermore, she had played 50 games across three seasons producing 20 shutouts and winning 34 matches while only allowing 35 goals. Her awards and recognition include the 2018-2019 PAC12 Championship, the NCAA National Championship in 2019, two College Cup appearances, 2019 College Cup All-Tournament Team, 2019 United Coaches West Region Third Team, 2019, 2020-2021 two-time PAC12 fall academic honor roll, and 2021 CoSIDA academic All-District 8,’ among others.</p><h3><strong>Katie Meyer Boyfriend</strong></h3><p>Based on Katie Meyer’s social media posts, she doesn’t seem to be in a relationship.

From 2013 to September 2017, he worked for Nickelodeon as Writer, Exec Story Editor, Creator till September 2017. Moreover, he is a graduate of the University of Iowa.</p><p>On 20 January, Steve took to his Instagram and wished his beloved daughter her 22nd birthday. He captioned, “Happiest of Birthdays to our Katie You’re amazing”.</p><p>Back in January 2020, before her 19th birthday, Katie interviewed with <a href=#>Just Women’s Sports</a>. She explained about the source of her positive energy and stated, “It comes from my parents, first and foremost. I can still remember my dad taking me to the parking garage in the mall so we could run up the incline with parachutes on. He and my mom just dumped everything into my sisters and me. So it’s them.”</p><p>Speaking of sisters, Katie has two — Samantha Perez (<a href=#>@sammmperezzz</a>) and Siena Meyer ( IG: <a href=#>@sienameyer</a> Twitter: <a href=#>@sienagracemeyer</a>).
