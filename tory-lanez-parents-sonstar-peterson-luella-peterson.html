Lanez began directing some of his music videos while living in South Florida and posted them on his YouTube channel. After seeing a video of Lanez freestyling over Lloyd Banks’ “Beamer, Benz, or Bentley,” Sean Kingston became interested in him. Kingston contacted Lanez in February 2010, telling him to meet up with him during Justin Bieber’s tour and later getting him to perform on there live. Lanez dropped the mixtapes Just Landed, One Verse One Hearse, Playing for Keeps, and Mr. 1 Verse Killah in 2010. Lanez signed with Kingston’s Time is Money Entertainment in 2011 and released the mixtapes Mr. Peterson, Chixtape, and Swavey. He later left the label to pursue a career as an independent artist.</p><h2>Tory Lanez parents: Sonstar Peterson, Luella Peterson</h2><p>Daystar Shemuel Shua Peterson was born in Brampton, Ontario, on July 27, 1992, to a Bajan father, Sonstar, and a Curaçao mother, Luella. The family lived in Montreal before relocating to Miami, Florida. Following his mother’s death, his father began working as an ordained minister and missionary, causing them both to move across the United States on a regular basis. Daystar’s father later remarried, and the family relocated to Atlanta, Georgia, where Daystar met his janitor friend Hakeem. Hakeem gave Daystar the nickname “Lanez” as a comment on his thrill-seeking tendencies, which sometimes saw him mucking around in the street, not looking for traffic and playing in the lanes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmJa7orLUqGWcp51kwbC%2B2GajmqaVr3qxrdGepa2rXai8r7%2FTmqlmqJWpsrO%2Fzqdkpa2Vobmiec%2Beq56qo6S7cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
