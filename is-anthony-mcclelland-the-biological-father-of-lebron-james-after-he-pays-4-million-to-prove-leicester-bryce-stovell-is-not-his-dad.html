LeBron James is wealthy and well-known, and sources indicate that he was forced to fork over nearly $4 million after a DNA test with a fake man who claimed to be his biological father failed.</p><h2><strong>Is Anthony McClelland The Father Of LeBron James After He Pays $4 Million To Prove Leicester Bryce Stovell Is Not His Dad</strong></h2><p></p><p></p><p>Essentially Sports states that LeBron has not yet learned who his father is. Gloria raised a child on her alone and went on to raise him to be one of the greatest basketballers ever. One individual attempted to identify himself as LeBron’s father because there was no information on his father. A protracted investigation that included DNA tests on LeBron and his mother eventually concluded in 2011.</p><p>A man named Leicester Bryce Stovell unexpectedly entered LeBron James and Gloria’s lives more than 20 years after the birth of “the King.” LeBron was already a star in the NBA at this point and was making millions of dollars. LeBron requested Stovell’s help even though his mother didn’t want anything to do with him.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Even though the test revealed that Stovell was not LeBron’s father, Stovell believed the results had been tampered with. Following this, Stovell filed a $4 million fraud, slander, and deception lawsuit against LeBron and Gloria. After several months, the presiding judge dismissed the case.</p><p>According to blacksportsonline.com Gloria Marie James and Anthony McClelland gave birth to the four-time NBA champion. LeBron James is at the height of his success right now, but getting there was not simply due to his challenging background.</p><p>James’s life was significantly shaped by Gloria while Anthony was largely absent. James did not have a positive father-son relationship as a child.</p><p>When Gloria gave birth to their son LeBron, Anthony and Gloria were just dating. However, Anthony was not the most encouraging parent at the time, and Gloria was only sixteen.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>McClelland had a long history of criminal activity. He also failed to make child support payments, leaving Gloria to care for LeBron by herself.</p><p>LeBron’s mother needed McClelland, but he wasn’t there for them. Gloria had trouble finding steady work, so they had to relocate from one apartment to another.</p><p>Along with LeBron James, McClelland is said to have fathered a son named Aaron McCelland Gamble with a different woman. LeBron’s hometown of Akron, Ohio, and where Aaron was born in 1987.</p><p>Aaron’s mother and Aaron’s father were left behind by Anthony, who also declined to assume responsibility for them.</p><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal rel="noopener noreferrer">Sergio Ramos Had Pressurised Luis Rubiales For Looking At Referees Bias Towards Barcelona Reveal Leaked Messages</a></strong></p><p>Advertisement</p><p><strong>Recommended:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer sponsored" data-wpel-link=external>The Sports Fan App</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrAsbvRraqgqpGeuW%2BvzqZmoqtdlru1tM6nsGalk5i5prjLmqWdZaSdsm6uyKijqJ%2BZmK6tecWaq6GdomK8p3nLnpmrp55it6K5xKxkmp6kmr9utMRmp5qxo2KBbrnIpaOip55iwbB5z6umr51dobKqr8Ssq56qXZe%2Fuq%2FEZqqtp6aaua15yKxkp6ekYrWqv4ydmJ1n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
