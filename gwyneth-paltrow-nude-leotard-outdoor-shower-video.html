During the latest episode of Hailey’s YouTube series titled&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Who’s In My Bathroom?, </a>Gwyneth made the quip after she told the supermodel she worked with<strong> Stephen Baldwin</strong> back in the day on a 1994 <strong>Dorothy Parker</strong> biopic called Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Gwyneth-Paltrow-Nude-Bodysuit-Shower-goop-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>The Shakespeare In Love actress added that Stephen “was great,” “so nice” and that the “movie was awesome.” Hailey replied, “‘I like hearing that. Imagine if you had some horror story. ‘He was terrible! It was a nightmare working with him!’” And that was Gwyneth’s opportunity to show off her wit. “That would be bad,” she said. “Or if I, like, f—– your dad in the bathroom?” After she added that she “didn’t,” a relieved Hailey exclaimed, “Well that’s good to know, okay!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>In the episode, Gwyneth also launched into the dual-edged sword that is nepotism in Hollywood, as both her and Hailey have famous parents. “As the child of someone, you get access other people don’t have, so the playing field is not level in that way,” Gwyneth said to Hailey. “However, I really do feel that once your foot is in the door, which you unfairly got in, then you almost have to work twice as hard and be twice as good. Because people are ready to pull you down and say ‘You don’t belong there’ or ‘You are only there because of your dad or your mom.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH15e5BxZqCvqaOytbSMqZilrKKkxG661J2cZqSVpMGivsNmpq6slKS8s3nSoaawnaJiw6qwxKhm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
