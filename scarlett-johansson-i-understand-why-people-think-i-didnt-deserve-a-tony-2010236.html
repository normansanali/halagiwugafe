A lot of it is luck and, certainly, a lot of it is opportunity — and the lack of that," Johansson told <a href=#>Broadway World</a>. "So, I totally understand the frustration there."</p><p>The 25-year-old actress' win prompted fellow Broadway star <strong>Hunter Foster</strong> to start a Facebook campaign, "Give The Tonys Back To Broadway." Foster believes Johansson's Hollywood status was the main reason behind her victory earlier this month, preventing Broadway veterans from taking home a trophy.</p><p>"The actors we've seen this season that we recognize from film — <strong>Denzel Washington</strong>, Viola Davis,&nbsp;<strong>Liev Schreiber</strong> and <strong>Catherine Zeta-Jones</strong>, etc. — have not only made a huge impact on ticket sales but have given tour de force performances and all started their careers as stage actors, dedicating themselves to making an impression in the theater," Johansson argued. "This goes to show that actors are actors, whatever the outlet, and with perseverance and drive, can cross the boundaries of the medium."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Still, the Iron Man 2 bombshell admits she can relate to the frustrations that Foster and other critics have expressed — but she's making no apologies.</p><p>"A lot of my friends who are struggling actors are going through the same thing. But, I can't apologize for it. I have worked my ass off to get to where I am so I understand that struggle," Johansson explained. "For me, it's more about hiring the right person for the job.&nbsp; If somebody is cast because they are a name but they're not right for the job, well, it's very frustrating."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqcmaKhsrXAjKOmoZmeqMCwuoyiZK6mlJq%2FtMDAp5tmr5iuerGxzqmjnmWknbavt4yiZJ2hlKPBbrDErJyrrpVirm7AzqewZmpgZn1zf5Vo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
