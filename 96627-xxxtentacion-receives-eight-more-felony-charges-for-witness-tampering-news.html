Last week,&nbsp;news broke that the rapper received an additional seven felony charges and was sent to jail as he awaits trial. Today, prosecutors have allegedly added eight more felony charges.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">XXXTENTACION's charges are up to fifteen, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">TMZ's report</a>. The rapper was hit with an additional eight charges earlier today and all of which have something to do with witness tampering. They&nbsp;say the prosecutors on the trial are citing witness tampering that occurred in October of 2016 for the additional charges. While all prison calls are monitored and recorded, XXXTENTACION made several phone calls while he was jailed last year that are being used as evidence for the additional charges. The new charges stem from when he was initially arrested.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">XXXTENTACION is now being held without bail and in addition, the judge has ordered that he doesn't have phone privileges while he's locked up.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">A few weeks a go, news broke that X's ex-girlfriend that he's accused of beating wasn't going to testify in court. The rapper and his attorney filed a document to the court with the woman's signature. However, prosecutors&nbsp;said they're doubtful that his ex-girlfriend signed off on the papers. And even if she did sign those papers, they say they're still willing to move forward with the prosecution.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">XXXTENTACION is looking at some serious jail time if he's convicted, possibly decades long.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Aron A. is a features editor for HotNewHipHop.
