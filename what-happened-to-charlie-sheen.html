To be clear, Chuck fired Charlie because of the actor's struggles with drugs and alcohol.

According to Charlie, he is focusing on his children, including his teen twins, Bob and Max.</p><p>Sheen explained that instead of drinking first thing in the morning, like he used to, these days, he gets up early, works out, and spends time with his kids. He also hopes to turn around his professional life.</p><p>For the longest time, I had the best work reputation. I was the first to arrive, last to leave, when in doubt, I would over prepare. I would just check every box. And then that went away. So I was really excited about being that guy again.</p><p>Charlie concluded that he's proud of himself for changing his life, and he doesn't miss "some alien version" of himself.</p><h2 id=how-charlie-sheen-is-making-money-now>How Charlie Sheen Is Making Money Now</h2><h3 id=charlie-sheen-is-worth-about-10-million>Charlie Sheen is worth about $10 million</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/instar50355552-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Charlie Sheen was — at one point — the highest-earning sitcom star on television, raking in $1.8M per episode of Two and a Half Men.
