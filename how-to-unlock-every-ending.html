Like many of Kirby’s classic adventures, this new Nintendo Switch journey sends them off to a faraway land to rescue Waddle Dees. They have been captured and can be found hidden around beautiful 3D environments. It’s important to collect as many of them as possible since they unlock access to content later in the game, including multiple endings. First, the player will need to clear the game’s main story.</p><p>Players can unlock the regular ending by defeating Fecto Elfilis in a boss battle. This fight is the final battle before unlocking access to the post-game. Once the battle is over, Fecto Elfilis will attempt to summon Popstar through a magic portal to cause it to <a href=#>crash into the Forgotten Lands</a>. After the credits roll, a cutscene will play of Kirby and Elfilin reuniting before they jump into the rift between the worlds. They need to work together to close this portal before it’s too late. This is when the game’s post-content can begin.</p><p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag>SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a class=bc-title-link title="Kirby Could Return To 2D After Forgotten Land" href=#>Kirby Could Return To 2D After Forgotten Land</a></span></p><p>There are two different endings to unlock in Kirby and the Forgotten Land. The first ending can be unlocked after defeating Fecto Elfilis. Although, the game’s true ending requires players to travel to the Isolated Isles: Forgo Dreams. In this location, the player will be tasked with collecting Leongar’s souls to rescue him. These souls function similarly to&nbsp;<a href=#>Kirby TFL‘s Waddle Dees</a> in all the other levels, so make sure to keep an eye out when exploring. Collecting them all will unlock the final stage, Forgo Land.</p><h2>Unlocking The True Ending in Kirby and the Forgotten Land</h2><figure class=item-img></figure><p>It’s important to mention that the stages in the Isolated Isles are much more difficult than those from the base game. There will be six stages with Leon’s soul littered throughout. Fortunately, Elfilin will give tips and hints whenever one of his souls is nearby. After collecting them all in the area, Elfilin will also comment about it, making it easier to know when to move to the next location. To unlock Forgo Land, the player will need to collect at least 250 pieces of Leon’s soul.</p><p>There are 300 souls in total to collect, meaning players will only need to collect 5/6ths of them to access the final stage. During the stage, the Soul Forgo will take control of Leongar, and the player will need to defeat it. Once that’s over, the Soul Forgo will leave Leongar and take control of a local butterfly, transforming into Morpho Knight. Fortunately, there will be a <a href=#>handful of copy abilities for Kirby</a> to use before entering this battle. Kirby will then need to defeat Morpho Knight in order to unlock the game’s true ending.</p><p><span class=next-single>More: <a class=bc-title-link title="Kirby & The Forgotten Land: Winter Horns Hidden Waddle Dee Guide" href=#>Kirby & The Forgotten Land: Winter Horns Hidden Waddle Dee Guide</a></span></p><p><strong>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</strong> is available now on Nintendo Switch.</p><p><strong><span class=next-btn-text-title>Ricky Gervais Posts Offensive Jokes In Response To Will Smith Slap</span></strong></p><p><strong class=section-sub-title>About The Author</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/39557768-1781742071862697-760867548274098176-n-1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><strong class=bio-title><br>Sky Flores<br><span class=amount>(2756 Articles Published)</span><br></strong><p>Sky Flores is a writer and game player based out of New York City.
