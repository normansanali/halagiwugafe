But Emily isn't convinced, and holds out hope her plan to pit the Graysons against their security guard will work.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"If Lydia dies, it's because she sold her soul to the Graysons," Emily snipes. "This wasn't supposed to happen. I didn't set any of this in motion — they did."</p><p>"As far as the Graysons know, Lydia attempted suicide," she continues. "When they see this video, they'll know Frank lied to them. Frank dug his own grave. All we need is for Victoria and Conrad to bury him in it."</p><p>Revenge airs Wednesday at 10 p.m. (EST) on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmerpWjtKZ50qecmqNdpbKmt4yiqmakqZm2onnRnpilpKlisaatw2ZpaWlhZ4NyfI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
