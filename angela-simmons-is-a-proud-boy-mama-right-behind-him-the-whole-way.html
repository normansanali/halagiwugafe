Simmons took to Instagram on the anniversary of <a href=#>her ex-fiance’s death</a> to give a beautiful tribute.</p><p>“Two years later,” the celebrity mom said. “Been on my mind heavy,” Angela continued. “This time of year brings back so many emotions. Still missing you here. So thankful you left me with such a shining light. Knowing that you would be as proud as me of your son. I could just hear you now speaking (bragging) about him. He’s everything you ever wanted him to be and more. Rest In Heaven.”</p><p>Angela Simmons has faced <a href=#>questions about Sutton Tennyson Sr.’s death</a> from their son. At one point, the celebrity mom was brought to tears while speaking with her life coach. Angela told her mentor about an instance where she showed Sutton Jr. pictures of his father. “Is he alive,” little Sutton asked his mom. Angela told her life coach that she tried explaining to her son that this father was in heaven. Such an explanation, however, did not seem like enough.</p><p>Thankfully, Angela has a strong support system that includes her parents and siblings. Rev Run even took his grandson out for a day of fun, which ended with Sutton Jr. enjoying a bit of Hip Hop.</p><p>Sutton Tennyson Jr. is Angela Simmons’s only child. He celebrates his fifth birthday in September.</p><p>Photo: Angela Simmons/Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiak6C8r7jIp5xnm5%2BifHN8kWpmaWtfZYZwrc2gnKWZXai2rrnOp6pmoaNirm680aisnWWSpMZuucCmmGaqmZy1tXnBnp%2BippRitaq5jK2fnmWnnbytsYywmLJn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
