Thank you for loving natural resources, but do not pick, (or) they will be ruined!” the statement said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In the </span><span>viral </span><span>one-minute video</span><span>, the three women are seen excitedly screaming as they approach the phallic-looking flowers. One woman holds two of the flowers in her hands as she coos towards the camera, while another holds a shorter one and makes a joke in reference to small penises.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The Nepenthes holdenii is a protected species and is included under the Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). They are carnivorous tropical pitcher plants that are often found in the mountains of western Cambodia.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>A spokesman for the Ministry of Environment, Neth Pheaktra, explained that five of 129 species of pitcher plants grow in regions of Cambodia.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The department’s website </span><span>also urged</span><span> people to not pick any wildflowers to maintain biodiversity.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“As more and more Cambodians travel to nature reserves, both for recreation and adventure, senior officials of the Ministry of Environment call on tourists to take care of the environment by properly packing and storing solid waste,” the website states. “And especially to take care of biodiversity, do not pick wild flowers that are protected to keep the seeds and maintain the beauty of the area for other tourists who love nature to visit.”</span></p><p><span>An official complaint against the three women has not been filed.</span></p><p><span>Feature Image via </span><span>Newsflare</span></p><h3>Support our Journalism with a Contribution</h3><p>Many people might not know this, but despite our large and loyal following which we are immensely grateful for, NextShark is still a small bootstrapped startup that runs on no outside funding or loans.</p><p>Everything you see today is built on the backs of warriors who have sacrificed opportunities to help give Asians all over the world a bigger voice.</p><p>However, we still face many trials and tribulations in our industry, from figuring out the most sustainable business model for independent media companies to facing the current COVID-19 pandemic decimating advertising revenues across the board.</p><p>We hope you consider making a contribution so we can continue to provide you with quality content that informs, educates and inspires the Asian community.<br><span class=donate_way><strong>Even a $1 contribution goes a long way.</strong></span> Thank you for everyone’s support.
