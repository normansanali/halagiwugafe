But then, the horrific tragedies began. Hotel patrons inexplicably leaped to their deaths out of their windows. At least one homicide took place there, when a guest brutally murdered a young socialite in one of the rooms, splattering the walls with her blood.</p><p>Meanwhile, guests of the notorious <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hotel Del Salto</a> claimed to witness spooky apparitions that appeared around the hotel at night — including the ghost of the murdered socialite.</p><p>In local legends, Tequendama Falls is said to have been where many people of the Indigenous Muisca tribe escaped from Spanish colonizers by leaping off the nearby cliff centuries before.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-302575 alt="True Scary Stories Hotel Del Salto" width=600 height=800 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/true-scary-stories-hotel-del-salto.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-302575 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Luis Alveart/Flickr</span><span class=caption-body>The Hotel del Salto sits on cliffs as tall as 500 feet.</span></p><p>Though the native legend says the Muisca were incarnated into flying eagles as they jumped off the cliff — thus surviving the brutal plunge — locals believe the land has since been cursed by the Muisca, some of whom may have not survived their attempts to escape the Spanish invaders.</p><p>Even after it was shuttered in the 1990s, scary stories about the hotel continued to emerge. Some claim that loud screams can still be heard coming from the abandoned hotel. Additionally, they say that the constant mudslides on the road to reach the property and the stench from the heavily polluted river water further prove paranormal activity on the grounds.</p><p>Today, the once run-down hotel has been converted into a sleek and stylish cultural museum. Curious visitors can tour the former hotel but only during business hours — which end at 5 p.m., well before scary stories say the ghosts appear.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony1vtSeZKybkafGbr%2FTqKminaNkgQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
