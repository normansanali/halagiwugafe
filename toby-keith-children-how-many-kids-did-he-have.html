The family resided in Fort Smith, Arkansas, for a few years during Keith’s grade school years, but later relocated to Moore, Oklahoma, a suburb of Oklahoma City.</p><p>During his younger years, before the move to Moore, Keith would spend his summers visiting his grandmother in Fort Smith. It was during these visits that he developed an interest in the musicians who performed at his grandmother’s establishment, Billie Garner’s Supper Club. Keith would help out with odd jobs at the club and eventually started playing with the band on the bandstand. At the age of eight, he received his first guitar.</p><p>After settling in Moore, Keith attended Highland West Junior High and Moore High School.

Despite his job in the oil industry, Keith pursued his passion for music by forming the Easy Money Band with his friends Scott Webb, Keith Cory, David “Yogi” Vowell, Danny Smith, and a few others. The band performed at local bars, but Keith would sometimes have to leave in the middle of a concert if he was called to work in the oil field.</p><p>In 1998, Keith signed with DreamWorks Records Nashville and released his breakthrough single “How Do You Like Me Now?!” in 1999.</p><p>This song, which was also the title track of his album, became the number-one country song of 2000 and marked the beginning of several chart-topping hits during his time with DreamWorks Nashville.
