According to sources, it has been estimated that DJ Ashba’s overall net worth is $12 million. Ashba has acquired his wealth by cooperating with many famous stars and artists throughout the years. His two released solo albums have also added to his net worth. Since he is still an active musician, his net worth continues to grow.</p><h3>DJ Ashba Net Worth $12 Million</h3><p>Ashba was raised in Fairbury, Illinois by his mother, who was a classically trained pianist. Thanks to her, Ashba started learning about music when he was a toddler. His fascination with music escalated when he turned 18, and he decided to move to Hollywood and pursue his own career. He soon joined the group “Barracuda” and toured with them for two years. Then in 1996 his debut solo album “Addiction to the Friction” was released, but two years later he joined the BulletBoys. During this period he met Joe Lesté with whom he would form a new band in 1999. This newly formed group, with three other members was named Beautiful Creatures, and signed with Warner Bros. to release their debut album by the same name, produced by <a href=#>Marilyn Manson</a>.</p><p>His net worth was growing steadily, however, Ashba left the band in 2002 and formed another solo ‘band’ called ASHBA, concentrating on building his solo career. A couple of years later, in August 2007, Ashba released the album “The Heroin Diaries Soundtrack” to critical acclaim, under the name “Sixx: A.M.”, in collaboration with <a href=#>Nikki Sixx</a> and James Michael; their single “Life is Beautiful” reached second place on the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks.</p><p>In March 2009, it was revealed to the public that Ashba would be the new lead guitarist of Guns N’ Roses; he toured with the band for nearly six years before announcing he was leaving in order to commit to his family and another band, “Sixx:A.M.”. Ashba also co-produced the Mötley Crüe’s album “Saints of Los Angeles” in 2008 for which he co-wrote 11 out of 13 songs. The title track was eventually nominated for a Grammy the same year.</p><p>Apart from his career as a musician, Ashba owns two corporations: “Ashba Media, Inc” and “Ashbaland, Inc.”. The first agency is the Agency of Record for Virgin Entertainment whose Megastore, Ashba overlooks thoroughly. On the other hand, he also launched his own creation of clothing and merchandise, called “Ashba Swag”. He closely collaborates with Cody Verona, the CEO of Cengregation of the Forgotton Saints in order to develop the custom Stage Clothing within “Ashba Swag”.</p><p>When it comes to his personal life, Ashba met his wife, Colombian model Nathalia Henao, in Rome during a tour with “Guns ‘N’ Roses”, and the couple married in August 2013. Ashba and his wife subsequently appeared in the hit TV show “Tanked”.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=25.70223880597><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>DJ Ashba</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$12 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>November 10, 1972</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Monticello, Indiana, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 8 in (1.75 m)</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Profession</td><td>Songwriter, Guitarist, Musician, Graphic Designer, Record producer, Composer, Businessperson</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Nathalia Henao (m. 2013)</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Kari Kaisner</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Nicknames</td><td>Daren Jay Ashba , dj_ashba</td></tr><tr readability=0.39024390243902><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/ashbaland</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.37837837837838><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/djashba</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.36842105263158><td>Google+</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://plus.google.com/+DjASHBA</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.42857142857143><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/djashba</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.37837837837838><td>MySpace</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.myspace.com/djashba</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm5109742</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.30188679245283><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.allmusic.com/artist/dj-ashba-mn0000655342</a></td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>Grammy Award (2008)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Record Labels</td><td>Warner Bros., Eleven Seven Music</td></tr><tr readability=14><td>Albums</td><td>Appetite for Democracy 3D (2014), The Heroin Diaries Soundtrack (2007), Live Is Beautiful (2008), Eli Roth's Goretorium - Songs For The Demented Mind (2012), This Is Gonna Hurt (2011), 7 (2011), Modern Vintage (2014), Prayers for the Damned (2016), Prayers for the Blessed (2016), Beautiful Creatures (2001)</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Music Groups</td><td>“Barracuda”, Guns N' Roses (2009 – 2015), BulletBoys (1998-1999), Beautiful Creatures (1999-2000), ASHBA, Sixx:A.M.
