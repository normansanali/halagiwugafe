He also predicted that she would soon become a well-known star in the industry, just like her father.</p><p>“The sky is the limit. She’s got the workhorse in her like we all do. It runs deep in the blood, and I’m excited for her future.”</p><p>“I can’t wait to see where this takes her.”</p><p>Uso stated that he won’t have any problems taking Ava under his wing because, after all, they are essentially family if/when she is called up from NXT to the main roster. Jimmy asserted that, “Anyway the family can get it, I’m all for it.” He further said, “We are all family. We all look out for her. She has the whole squad side on her side.” Simone appears to have Uso’s full support.</p><p>“I’m ready to see what she can do.
