Elway had an outstanding 16-year career as the quarterback with the Denver Broncos and took them to two Super Bowl championships, during his tenure he established himself as one of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history. After retiring, he entered the business world and in 2012 returned as EVP of Football Operations for the Denver Broncos. Still, even as his business prospered, Elway ran into financial trouble and he struggled with it in recent years.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>John Elway's Legendary Career</h2><p>Elway was regarded as one of the finest talents and leaders in his position during his time with the Denver Broncos. In 2004 he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame and his No. 7 jersey is retired by the Broncos. He then moved into the front office, becoming the Broncos General Manager and Executive VP of football operations, which led to his involvement in building a team that helped win Super Bowl 50.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Economic Struggles and Hardship</h2><p><br data-mce-fragment=1>Elway took a major financial hit in 2010, compounding the mini-depression he was already mired in when Wickstrom's Denver Post asked him about it: He'd put up $15 million with a hedge-fund manager whom was later convicted of running a Ponzi scheme.&nbsp;Elway wound up losing close&nbsp;to the tune of $3 million from this scheme. This incident highlights the need for extensive due diligence to be performed before a significant financial investment is made. Even with this minor drubbing Elway persevered, he was buoyed by a resilience and an attitude that enabled him to trudge through the mud.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Present Affairs and Grit</h2><p>In recent years, it has been cool to see just how Elway's job with the Denver Broncos has been changing.&nbsp;Elway worked as the Broncos' GM/Executive VP of football operations since 2021 and shifted into a role as president of football operations in Denver before departing to become an outside consultant in 2022. Elway remains amenable to supporting the team as a resource despite no longer being in an official role with the franchise, illustrating his continuing love of football and the organization.</p><p><br data-mce-fragment=1>Elway's story represents the grit and versatility it takes to overcome significant financial obstacles, even among those who enjoy a high degree of success in their professional lives. His ongoing work in football is a testament to his passion for the game and the community that has, now more than ever, been central to his life.<br data-mce-fragment=1>Ultimately, John Elway's story is one of highs and lows, the strength to flourish under duress. From a Hall of Famer in football to his ventures into the business world before returning to football, Elway's journey remains one that some still will talk about. Not many of the younger generation would be able to identify with that level of commitment as Elway was always dedicated, and despite going through financial turmoil he has managed to keep his ties with the Denver Broncos intact and showed he is still passionate about everything surrounding him. Now a continued figurehead in the football community, Elway's story is an example of exact persistence to overcome rough times.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0miln6Rfnby4ecOim2ain527brHLsJiyZZykwKZ5zKKjpaGfo8Buu8Vmm6iknJa%2FtA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
