Following an awkward lunch between Noella Bergener and Nicole James, during which Nicole seemed more concerned with getting Noella up and out of a restaurant rather than consoling her as she broke down over her messy split from James Bergener, Tamra revealed what may be a big explanation for Nicole’s behavior."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It seemed very contrived to me. She’s doing a lot. She’s doing a lot of extra stuff,” Brandi said, adding that Noella “didn’t seem intoxicated” to her.</p><p>As for <a href=# rel=noopener>Noella and James’ split</a>, Tamra said the breakup happened as <a href=# rel=noopener>RHOC season 16</a> was filmed — and that she heard James “didn’t want to film.” She also noted that Noella and James were allegedly living in Puerto Rico together when she learned <a href=# rel=noopener>she had been cast</a>.</p><p>“They were living in Puerto Rico. He didn’t just buy the house. They were living in Puerto Rico, had been there for a while, because there was pictures and videos of them on Instagram of them there. I was even invited to that house. And then she got hired and I heard that he said, ‘This is not going to be good. We have too many issues. This is not going to be good for my career,’” Tamra alleged.</p><p>According to Tamra, Noella returned to her and James’ Newport Beach rental after being chosen for season 16.</p><p>“I think it is a lot. And I feel like, as a viewer, it’s [<a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Gina Kirschenheiter</strong></a>]’s situation all over again. She comes in, <a href=# rel=noopener>instantly gets divorced</a>. We never see <a href=# rel=noopener>the husband</a>. We never see the kids. How do we get invested in a story that we only see one side of?” Tamra wondered.</p><p>Also on the podcast episode, Tamra shared an odd detail about her interaction with <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Denise Richards</strong></a> post-<a href=# rel=noopener>Brandi affair rumors</a>.</p><p>“She called me when that happened,” Tamra revealed. “When she got home [from Rome] she called me. And she’s like, ‘I didn’t do it. It didn’t happen.’ She says she has text messages.”</p><p>“I don’t know why she called me,” she added.</p><p><strong>RHOC&nbsp;Live Viewing</strong>&nbsp;– This is also the live viewing thread for tonight’s new episode of&nbsp;The Real Housewives of Orange County&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">season 16</a>, which airs at 9/8c on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6toqpiksLR505qkq5ldn8Kls8Rmq5qkm6h6r7vEpaOaq12WxKzDwKubZqSlo7Cpedaiq6Flnp6wsLjEaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
